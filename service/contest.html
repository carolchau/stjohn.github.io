<p><font size=+1>Each year, the </font><a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM</a>
<font size=+1>holds a series of Programming Contests.&nbsp; The regional
contests are held in November of each year.&nbsp; The winner of the regional
contest goes on to the International Contest.&nbsp; There are prizes at
both levels that include computer hardware and software, scholarships,
and just plain cash.&nbsp; Here's some general information about the contests:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>This year's regional contest will be held at&nbsp; Kean College
in Union, New Jersy on Sunday, 5 November 2000.&nbsp; For more information,
see&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/acm">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/acm
.</a></font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>Students enter in teams of three.&nbsp; They compete, at
the regional level, in three different categories:&nbsp; teams consisting
solely of freshmen and sophomore students, undergraduate teams with at
least one upperclassman, and teams with a graduate student on them.&nbsp;
Prizes are awarded to the top teams in each category.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>Contestants have 5 hours to solve 6 or more posed programming
problems.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font size=+1>At the Math &amp; Computer Science Club meeting on 23 March,
we discussed the first problem from the 1999 International Finals (see
<a href="http://acm.baylor.edu/past/.">the
past exam site for the complete exam</a> ).&nbsp; The question asked for
you to find the distance between any two cells of a "honeycomb," where
the cells are numbered clockwise from the center:</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="honeycomb.gif" NOSAVE height=293 width=339></center>

<p><font size=+1>We started by trying to figure out the distance between
the cell numbered "1" and a cell entered by the user, which we will call
"a."</font>
<p><font size=+1>First, at the meeting, we started looking at the 4 o'clock,
8 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 12 o'clock, and 2 o'clock branches that extend from
the center.&nbsp; We didn't give enough conditions for those branches:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>Notice that if a is on the 4 o'clock branch extending out
from 1, then (a-1)/6 == 0.&nbsp; But that's not quite enough, since (25-1)/6
== 0, but 25 is not on that branch.&nbsp; So, we need more conditions than
what we had on the board.&nbsp; We noticed that the differences between
the cells on the 4 o'clock branch was 7-1 = 6, 19-7=12,&nbsp; 37-19=18,
61-37=24.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we can write: 61 = 24+18+12+6+1 = 4*6+3*6+2*6+1*6+1
= (4+3+2+1)*6+1.&nbsp; We can figure out similar formula for if a is on
any of the other branches.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>We can write a simple loop to give the distance for cells
on the 4 o'clock branch:</font></li>

<pre>int dist = 0, i, sum = 0;
for ( i = 0 ; i &lt; a/6 ; i++ )
{
&nbsp; sum += i;
&nbsp; if ( a == (sum*6+1) )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dist = i;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break;
&nbsp; }
}</pre>

<li>
<font size=+1>The above loop checks if a is equal to the sum (1+2+3+...+i).&nbsp;
What if you check whether a is less than sum*6+1?&nbsp; When i = 1, this
gives all the elements within distance 1 from the center.&nbsp; When i=2,
we have sum*6+1= 19, or all elements within 2 from the center.&nbsp; In
general, if a is less than or equal to (1+2+...+i)*6+1, then a is within
distance i from the center.&nbsp; So, by changing the equality sign to
a less than or equal sign above, we have the distance from a to the center.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br><font size=+1>Now, for the general case, when you need to find the
distance between two cells a and b.&nbsp; One way to approach this is if
b=1, then we're done.&nbsp; Otherwise, think about shifting the whole honeycomb
over (including where a and b are) until b is now numbered 1.&nbsp; Then,
use the loop above to calculate the distance.</font></ul>
