<p> <img src="michael.jpg"> Michael Hintze, a junior from Queens, is a mathematics major and 
member of the Macaulay Honors College.  He is part of an interdisciplinary 
team focusing on understanding phylogenetic treespaces (all possible 
evolutionary histories for a set of species) and improving 
searches for the optimal phylogenetic tree.  
His research is being supported by the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation in Research and Education (LSAMP) and National Science Foundation 
grant awarded to his mentor, Prof. Katherine St. John.
This summer, he has been 
accepted to the prestiguous Research In Industrial Projects for Students
(RIPS) at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) at UCLA,
where he will work in a team on a real-world research project.  At Lehman, 
he is also a member of the mens varsity soccer team.  After graduation, he
is considering graduate school in applied mathematics or a career in finance.

<p> <img src="alan.jpg"> Alan Joseph Caceres, a sophomore from the Bronx, is a computer science major.  
He is part of an interdisciplinary team focusing on understanding phylogenetic 
treespaces (all possible evolutionary histories for a set of species) and improving 
searches for the optimal phylogenetic tree.  He has developed algorithms to search
for minimal paths through treespaces.  His poster on this work won a second prize
award at the poster competition at the FGL-LSAMP Expo 2010 help in February at
the University of South Florida.
His research is being supported by the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation in Research and Education (LSAMP) and National Science Foundation 
grant awarded to his mentor, Prof. Katherine St. John.  Through the CUNY Institute
of Software Design and Development, Alan has also been an intern in 
the public schools, working on improving technology in the classroom.  After
graduation, he plans to go to graduate school in computer science.
