      <p>Evolutionary trees, or phylogenies, are an essential tool in
biology,
used in all kinds of processes such as understanding evolution,
designing
new drugs, predicting gene expression, and determining the origin of a
virus strain. Often, for one reason or another, scientists get a large
set of possible phylogenies, and they would like to understand the
structure of the set and the relationships between the various possible
evolutionary
trees. We are writing computer software for this task. </p>

We are looking for several undergraduate students to join this project.
&nbsp;The requirements are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>enrolled as a full-time student at CUNY,</li>
  <li>have at least a 3.5 GPA,</li>
  <li>completed three semesters of Java programming,</li>
  <li>have three or more semesters until graduation,<br>
  </li>
  <li>have excellent communication skills, and</li>
  <li>works well with others. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The project includes:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>implementation of features and tools to a large java tool
designed and maintained by our group,</li>
  <li>an individual research project with researchers (at CUNY, UT
Austin, and UC Davis) with the goal of publishing the results,</li>
  <li>travel to meet with other researchers, and</li>
  <li>the use of a laptop computer.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For students who are US Citizens or permanent residents, funding is
available (via <a href="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a>
grant #0121651).

</a> If you are interested, please send a resume, unofficial
transcripts, and sample of a large group programming project in which
you made a significant contribution to <a
 href="mailto:stjohn@lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@lehman.cuny.edu</a>.
&nbsp;Include with the programming project a brief description of what
the program does, for whom it was
written (e.g. a course, an internship project), the number of
programmers involved, and your role in the project.
