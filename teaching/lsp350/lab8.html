<h1>Laboratory Exercise 8<br>
</h1>

<h2>LSP 150: Computers &amp; Society<br>
Lehman College-- CUNY<br>16 November 2005</h2>

<h3>Communication</h3>
Today's lab focuses on communication. The first set of programs
beams a number to another robot, who responds by beeping. The second
set of programs has one robot managing the actions of an "army" of
other robots.


<p><b>Design requirements:</b>  This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C.  Further, each 
motor is attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.).  When using the light sensor, it is wired to 
sensor port 2.  The touch sensor is wired to sensor port 1
and is attached to a bumper).

<h3>Sending Messages</h3>

Pick a number between 1 and 7.&nbsp; Write a program called <tt>sendMessage.nqc</tt> that 
will send that number.&nbsp; To test
your program, ownload the <a href="beep.nqc">beep.nqc</a> program to one
robot and your send message program to another robot.&nbsp;  So, one robot will be running
the <tt>beep.nqc</tt> program and the other will be running
<tt>sendMessage.nqc</tt>.<br>

<br>

Next, write a program that will pick a random number between 1 and
7.&nbsp; Built in to NQC is a function that will randomly choose
numbers for you.&nbsp; For example, <br>

<pre>x = Random(4);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; // Generates a random number between 0 and 4<br></pre>

will assign a random number to the variable x, between 0 and 4.&nbsp;
For this program, you should choose a number larger than 0, since you'd
like the robot to beep at least once.&nbsp; For example, if you'd like
a number between 1 and 10 stored in variable x, you could use:<br>

<br>

<pre>x = Random(9)+1;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   // Generates a random number between 1 and 10<br></pre>


<br>
Use the random number generator to generate a number between
1 and 7 to be sent.&nbsp; To make it easier to tell if your robot is
doing the right thing, we'll use a trick to make the view screen to
display the number.&nbsp; Since the <tt>OUT_B</tt> port is not being used, set the power level for <tt>OUT_B </tt>to be the random number you just generated (see the NQC Reference Sheet for how to set the power levels).<br>
<br>
Modify the <tt>beep.nqc</tt> program to display the incoming
message as the value for <tt>OUT_B</tt>, as well as beeping
that number of times.


<p>
Next, write a program that will turn left if it receives
an even number as a message and turns right if it receives
an odd number.


</p>

<h3>Simon Says</h3>Now, we'll write a set of programs for your robots
to play "Simon Says."&nbsp; One robot will be in charge and issue
"commands" that the other robots must follow.&nbsp; You should design
at least 4 distinct actions for the following robots to perform.&nbsp;
Some possible actions could be:<br>
<ul>
  <li>beep some number of times, or until a new command is issued,<br>
  </li>
  <li>sing a song,</li>
  <li>turn 360 degrees,<br>
  </li>
  <li>move forward or backwards, etc.</li>
</ul>
The robot in charge, "Simon," issues a command, chosen randomly, every 2 seconds, and the followers must<br>
perform it.&nbsp; For this part of the laboratory, you must have one Simon and at least two followers.<br>

<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>



To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>



<br>



We must be out of the computer laboratory by 11:50am.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 11:45am, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.
