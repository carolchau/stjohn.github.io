<h2>LSP 350: Computers &amp; Society<br>

<h3>Format</h3>
Quiz 2 consists of two parts:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz on the reading, and</li>
  <li>A short essay based on the reading.</li>
</ol>
For Part 1, the Blackboard system randomly chooses from a pool of
questions to make the quiz.&nbsp; If you are not happy with your score,
you can take the quiz over, and a new set of random questions will be
generated.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, you need to enter your essay answer to the chosen
question.&nbsp; Since there's several to choose from, make sure to
clearly mark at the beginning which question you have chosen to
answer.&nbsp; Spelling and grammar do count, so, please use a
spell-checker before entering your essay.&nbsp; Since Blackboard will
only accept plain text, it is probably easiest to write your essay in a
word processor and then cut-and-paste it into the quiz window.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The questions in Part 1 are straightforward and based on the
reading.&nbsp; The best way to study for this is to do the reading.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, choose one of the following questions and write a short
essay.&nbsp; Your essay should be about a page long and clearly address
the question.&nbsp; The questions below are from p 42 of the text:<br>
<br>
1. The issue on
immigration to the United States is controversial. Do you agree with
AnnaLee Saxenian's arguments? Why or why not?<br>
<br>
2. In "You're
Hired, Now Go Home," Jeanne Allert cites four traits to look for when
hiring an individual to do virtual work. What traits would you add?<br>
<br>
3.
Suppose you learned that your university is reading sutdent e-mail to
protect itself from sexual harassment suites and its students from
sexual harassment itself. Have the course said anything about a
university's rights and obligations in these matters? What is the
policy at CUNY? Do you think it is appropriate?<br>
