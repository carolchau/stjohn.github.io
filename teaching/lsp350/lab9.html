<h3>Rotation Sensor<br>
</h3>
Today's lab focuses on using a new sensor, called the rotation sensor.
The rotation sensor measures the amount something has turned.&nbsp;
We'll write several programs to test the rotation sensor and then use
it to&nbsp; go exact distances, independent of how strong the batteries
in the robot are.
<p><b>Design requirements:</b> This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C. Further, each motor is
attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.).&nbsp; A rotation sensor should be attached to the shaft of
one of your motors and connected to a sensor port.
</p>
<h3>Testing the Sensor<br>
</h3>
The rotation sensor allows us to measure how much something has
turned.&nbsp; Like other sensors, you must tell the robot what kind of
sensor you are using.&nbsp; For example, to set up a rotation sensor on
an input port you have called ANGLE (that is, you have #define at the
top of the program saying which input port is called ANGLE):<br>
<pre>   SetSensor(ANGLE, SENSOR_ROTATION);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </pre>
The sensor can measure how far something has turned (see p. 28-29 for
pictures) in increments of 22.5 degrees.&nbsp; So, a value for the
rotation sensor of 16 occurs when you've turned 16*22.5 = 360
degrees.&nbsp; So, a full rotation equals a measurement of 16.&nbsp; If
you would like to turn 90 degrees, you would stop when you see a
measure measurement of 4.&nbsp; To test the value of the rotation
sensor, we use the same format as for other sensors.&nbsp; For example,
assume ANGLE is the input port for your sensor.<br>
<br>
<pre>  until (ANGLE == 16);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   // Wait until one full rotation has occurred<br></pre>
<br>
To start today, write a simple program that moves both motors forward
at a very, very slow speed and has a rotation sensor attached to one of
the motors.&nbsp; Use the view button to examine the input from the
rotation sensor.&nbsp; What values does it take?&nbsp; Change the
program (or the motor leads) so that the robot goes backwards.&nbsp;
What happens to the values from the rotation sensor?<br>
<br>
Next, write a program that will beep every full revolution of the
motors.<br>
<h3>Going Precise Distances</h3>
With a rotation sensor, you can now write programs where your robot
goes precise distances.&nbsp; This makes going repeatable distances
(for example, as in the obstacle course) much easier, since you no
longer have to adjust the time to make up for weakening
batteries.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Write a program, using the rotation sensor that will trace out one side
of a tile on the floor.&nbsp; Note that this will likely be several
full rotations.&nbsp; Use your second program from before to get a
rough estimate (the number of beeps equals the number of full
rotations) and then perfect your program by trial and error.<br>
Next, write a program that will trace out a complete square.<br>
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 11:50am.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 11:45am, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.
