<h1>Grading Rubric for Writing Assignments<br>
</h1>
<h2>LSP 350: Computers &amp; Society<br>
Lehman College-- CUNY<br>
Fall 2005</h2>
<hr><br>
Grades for the writing assignments are based on a 10 point scale, or
rubric.&nbsp; This rubric is based on the ones used for grading
standardized exams such as the AP Writing Exam.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
First, your essay is graded following the guidelines below.&nbsp; Then
it's multiplied by a factor to give the correct number of points for
the assignment.&nbsp; For example, Quiz 2 is worth 30 points.&nbsp; So,
if your rubric score is 9 on the writing part of Quiz 2, then your
score will be multiplied by 3 (eg 9 * 3 = 27) to give the grade for the
assignment.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
All writing assignments can be resubmitted if you are not happy with
your initial grade.<br>
