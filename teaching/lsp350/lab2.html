<h1>Laboratory Exercise 2</h1>
<h2>LSP 350: Computers &amp; Society<br>

<h3>Using Loops</h3>
Today's lab is on using loops in programs and is based on
the <a href="pirouette.nqc">pirouette.nqc</a>,
the <a href="duet.nqc">duet.nqc</a>, and
the <a href="forTurn.nqc">forTurn.nqc</a> from lecture.
<p><b>Design requirements:</b> This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C. Further, each motor is
attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.). </p>
<p> A touch sensor and bumper, wired to input port 1, is needed if you
would like to do the extra activities in the
last section.
</p>
<p><b>Lab Set-up:</b> A simple obstable course should be
set up (a slalom course works well) that has even spaced
obstables and at least 6 turns. The goal is to have the
robots do laps around the course-- precision, not speed,
is what matters.
</p>
<h3>Square and Hexagons</h3>
The first part of this lab is to rewrite the program that
traces out a square using a loop. Copy your turnInPlace
program to a new file called <tt>ngon.nqc</tt>.
Now, modify <tt>ngon.nqc</tt>. You will need to do the following steps
(in between each step,
test the program on the robot, to make sure it's doing
the right thing):
<ol>
  <li> Have the robot turn only 90 degrees or a quarter of the way
around. </li>
  <li> Now, have the robot walk straight, followed by turning 90
degrees. </li>
  <li> Put a loop "around" your statements above so that it repeats
these statements 4 times. </li>
</ol>
What changes if you want to draw a hexagon instead? How about a
octagon?
<h3>Ngons</h3>
Modify your program so that <b>only one</b> constant needs
to be changed to change the number of sides your robot traces out. We
will use this program as part of
a future lab, so, save it somewhere where you can find it
again.
<h3>Obstacle Course</h3>
There is a simple obstacle course set up outside the lab.
The goal is to have your robot make as many laps
around the course as possible. For future labs, we will use the touch
sensors for the obstacle course. For this lab, you will need to go
solely
by the amount of time that has passed and calculate when to
turn based on time.
<p>First, make a program called <tt>lap.nqc</tt> that can make
one lap around the track. Then, add a loop so that your robot will make
5 laps around the track.
</p>
<h3>Some Extra Programs</h3>
If you have time, download the following programs:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Singing:</b> Download <a href="sing.nqc">sing.nqc</a>
to your directory. Compile the program and download it to the robot.
The robot can store up to 5 programs at a time.&nbsp; Note that there
is also a "Piano" panel in BricxCC that will allow you to test out
music.</li>
  <li> <b>Bumper:</b> Download <a href="guidenqc/bumpbot1.nqc">bumpbot1.nqc</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
First read them on the screen, and then test them on your robot.&nbsp;
Did they do what you expected?&nbsp; <br>
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 11:50am.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 11:45am, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.<br>
