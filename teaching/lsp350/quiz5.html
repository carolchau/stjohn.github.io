<h1>Quiz 5<br>
</h1>
<h2>LSP 350: Computers &amp; Society<br>
Lehman College-- CUNY<br>
Fall 2005</h2>
<hr><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Date:</span>&nbsp; 26 October
2005<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading:</span>&nbsp; Unit 4:
Computers, People, and Social Participation in <span style="font-style: italic;">Annual Editions</span>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<h3>Format</h3>
Quiz 2 consists of two parts:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz on the reading, and</li>
  <li>A short essay based on the reading.</li>
</ol>
For Part 1, the Blackboard system randomly chooses from a pool of
questions to make the quiz.&nbsp; If you are not happy with your score,
you can take the quiz over, and a new set of random questions will be
generated.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, you need to enter your essay answer to the chosen
question.&nbsp; Since there's several to choose from, make sure to
clearly mark at the beginning which question you have chosen to
answer.&nbsp; Spelling and grammar do count, so, please use a
spell-checker before entering your essay.&nbsp; Since Blackboard will
only accept plain text, it is probably easiest to write your essay in a
word processor and then cut-and-paste it into the quiz window.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The questions in Part 1 are straightforward and based on the
reading.&nbsp; The best way to study for this is to do the reading.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, choose one of the following questions and write a short
essay.&nbsp; Your essay should be about a page long and clearly address
the question.&nbsp; The questions below are from p 76 of the text:<br>
<br>
1. The overview of this unit mentions Alexis de Tocqueville's
observation that Americans tend to form civic associations and Robert
Putman's argument that the tendency is declining.&nbsp; Do you think
that computing has played any part in the decline?&nbsp; What does
Putnam say?&nbsp; Wat do other scholars say about Putnam's work?<br>
<br>
2. Howard Rheingold, in "Is that a Computer in Your Pansts?" says,
"we're entering a world in which the complexity of the devices and the
system of interconnecting devices is beyond our capacity to easily
understand."&nbsp; Is this cause for alarm?&nbsp; Can anything be done
about it?&nbsp; What are your suggestions?<br>
<br>
3. After reading "Why Women Avoid Computer Science," why do you think
so few women study computing?<br>
