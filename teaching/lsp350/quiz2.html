<h1>Quiz 2<br>
</h1>
<h2>LSP 350: Computers &amp; Society<br>
Lehman College-- CUNY<br>
Fall 2005</h2>
<hr><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Date:</span>&nbsp; 28 September
2005<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading:</span>&nbsp; Unit 1:
Introduction in <span style="font-style: italic;">Annual Editions</span>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<h3>Format</h3>
Quiz 2 consists of two parts:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz on the reading, and</li>
  <li>A short essay based on the reading.</li>
</ol>
For Part 1, the Blackboard system randomly chooses from a pool of
questions to make the quiz.&nbsp; If you are not happy with your score,
you can take the quiz over, and a new set of random questions will be
generated.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, you need to enter your essay answer to the chosen
question.&nbsp; Since there's several to choose from, make sure to
clearly mark at the beginning which question you have chosen to
answer.&nbsp; Spelling and grammar do count, so, please use a
spell-checker before entering your essay.&nbsp; Since Blackboard will
only accept plain text, it is probably easiest to write your essay in a
word processor and then cut-and-paste it into the quiz window.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The questions in Part 1 are straightforward and based on the
reading.&nbsp; The best way to study for this is to do the reading.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, choose one of the following questions and write a short
essay.&nbsp; Your essay should be about a page long and clearly address
the question.&nbsp; The questions below are from p xvi of the text:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Samuel F.B. Morse transmitted over the telegraph, "What has God
wrought?" He was quoting from the poem of Balaam in the Book of
Numbers, chapter 23 (<a href="http://www.cforc.com/kjv/numbers/23.html">http://www.cforc.com/kjv/numbers/23.html</a>).&nbsp;
Read the text of this poem.&nbsp; The overview to this unit presents
two ways to understand technical and scientific discoveries.&nbsp; In
which camp is Morse?&nbsp; Explain your answer.</li>
  <li>In Walden, Thoreau remarked that "Our inventions are wont to be
pretty toys, which distract our atttention from serions things.&nbsp;
They are but an improved means to an unimproved end, an end that it was
already but too easy to arrive at... We are in great haste to construct
a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Main and Texas, it may
be, have nothing important to communicate."&nbsp; Substitute "internet"
for "magnetic telegraph."&nbsp; Do you agree or disagree with
Thoreau?&nbsp; Defend your answer.</li>
  <li>The invention of the computer is often compared in social impact
to the invention of moveable type in the fifteenth century.&nbsp; Do
you agree?&nbsp; Why or why not?</li>
