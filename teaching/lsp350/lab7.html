<h3>Locomotion &amp; Gears<br>
</h3>
Today's lab focuses on using using gears and different ways to make
your robot move.&nbsp; In particular, we'll look at how gearing can
improve speed and torque.<br>
<p><b>Design requirements:</b> In this lab, we will build and test by
hand (but not attached to the robots) the concepts about gearing and
locomotion in Chapter 4.&nbsp; For this part, you will need a piece of
string in addition to the standard lego parts.<br>
We will also build robots for a drag-race and for a tug-a-war.<br>
 </p><h3>Basic Gearing<br>
</h3>
The Lego robots come with four standard gears: 8, 16, 24, and 40 teeth
gears.&nbsp; These can be combined&nbsp; to with our motors to produce
either more rotations ("gearing up") or less rotations ("gearing
down").&nbsp; This first part of the lab asks you to figure about which
combination of gears produce more or less rotations and what is there
ratio.<br>
<br>
Take a piece of string and attach a couple of legos to one end.&nbsp;
Attach two 16-tooth gears to one of the black beams using medium length
black bars.&nbsp; The gears should mesh when you attach them to the
black beam.&nbsp; On the other end of the black bars attach grey circle
plates (one will be used as a handle).&nbsp; See p 73 of the Baum textbook.&nbsp; Turn
the handle-- the second gear should move the same speed.&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li>What happens if you replace the two 16-tooth gears with two
24-tooth gears?&nbsp; Which pulley (the grey disk) moves faster?&nbsp;
What is the ratio between the speeds?</li>
  <li>What happens if you use a 8-tooth and 24-tooth gears?&nbsp; Which
pulley (the grey disk) moves faster?&nbsp; What is the ratio between
the speeds?</li>
  <li>What happens if you use a 24-tooth and 40-tooth gears?&nbsp;
Which pulley (the grey disk) moves faster?&nbsp; What is the ratio
between the speeds?</li>
  <li>Due to the physical size of the Lego pieces, some of the gearing
combinations can't be placed together on the black beam.&nbsp; Which
combinations are those?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Next, build the compound drive train from p 74.&nbsp; Note that it uses
multiple stages of gears to create gear ratios that could be far larger
or smaller than available from a single pair of gears.&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li>What is the gear ratio from this compound drive train?</li>
  <li>Hook this drive train up to a motor and run a simple program that
will make the motor move forward.&nbsp; Try to stop the motor with your
hand by holding on to each of the grey disks.&nbsp; Which disk has
greater torque?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Drag Race</h3>

Next, build the fastest robot possible.&nbsp; To do this, you will likely want to try different gearing configuations<br>
and examine the compound drive train you built above.&nbsp; We will race the robots in the hallway to see whose is fastest.<br>
<h3>Tug-a-War</h3>
We will also have a tug-a-war, where two robots each are attached to a
rope, and they try to pull the other one across the line.&nbsp; Note to
increase the pulling power of your robot, you will have to "gear down"
the motors and give up speed.<br>
<br>
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 11:50am.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 11:45am, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.
