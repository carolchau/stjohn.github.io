  <li> <b>Description:</b>&nbsp; Computers have become an integral
part of our daily lives.&nbsp;
In this seminar, we look at the effects of computers on
society, in particular the incorporation and long-reaching consequences
of robotics on how we interact with the world.&nbsp; To give depth
and context to this discussion, the course includes a
hands-on component of designing and programming Legos Mindstorm
Robots.&nbsp; The basics of locomotion, design, as well as introductory
programming (in a variant of the popular C-programming language,
customized
for the robots) will be taught.&nbsp; As part of the seminar,
students will design and implement a robotics project of their
choosing.&nbsp;
Students in the course will write traditional essays, as well as a
technical guides to using their robotics projects.<br>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Textbook:</b> There are two required textbooks:<br clear="all">
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Annual Editions: Computers
in Society</span><br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Dave Baum's Definitive
Guide to Lego Mindstorm Robots</span><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Grading:</b> The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Computer Laboratory Exercises: 30%<br>
      </li>
      <li>Written Homework &amp; Quizzes: 30%</li>
      <li>Class Participation: 10%&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Final Project: 30%<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Computer Laboratory
Exercises:&nbsp;</span> Laboratory exercises are posted on the class
website, usually the week before class.&nbsp; They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and should be completed within 3 weeks of the
original laboratory.&nbsp; Note that has the semester progresses, the
exercises will take design and programming outside of class to
complete.&nbsp; To receive credit for an laboratory exercise, you must
demonstrate the working robot, the associated programs, and explain how
they work.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Written Homework &amp; Quizzes:</b> There will be written
homework and quizzes based on the the readings for class.&nbsp; In
general, the first assignment on any reading will be due the Wednesday
before it's discussed in class.&nbsp; We will use the on-line
Blackboard system for both written exercises and quizzes.&nbsp; You can
resubmit written homework and quizzes for regrading within 3 weeks of
the original due date.&nbsp; See the course webpage for more details
about homework and quizzes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project</span><b>:</b>&nbsp;
This course will have a significant project of your own design or a
15-20 page term paper.&nbsp; Your project should include a robot
designed to solve a given problem,
associated programs, and a webpage documenting how to use and maintain
your robot.&nbsp; More information about the project will be available
on the course website.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.&nbsp; You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's <a href="acadPol.pdf">academic integrity code</a> (available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). <br>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. </li>
  <li> <b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories.&nbsp; These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus.&nbsp; Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.&nbsp; <br>
