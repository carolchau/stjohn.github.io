<h3>Format</h3>
Quiz 2 consists of two parts:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz on the reading, and</li>
  <li>A short essay based on the reading.</li>
</ol>
For Part 1, the Blackboard system randomly chooses from a pool of
questions to make the quiz.&nbsp; If you are not happy with your score,
you can take the quiz over, and a new set of random questions will be
generated.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, you need to enter your essay answer to the chosen
question.&nbsp; Since there's several to choose from, make sure to
clearly mark at the beginning which question you have chosen to
answer.&nbsp; Spelling and grammar do count, so, please use a
spell-checker before entering your essay.&nbsp; Since Blackboard will
only accept plain text, it is probably easiest to write your essay in a
word processor and then cut-and-paste it into the quiz window.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The questions in Part 1 are straightforward and based on the
reading.&nbsp; The best way to study for this is to do the reading.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, choose one of the following questions and write a short
essay.&nbsp; Your essay should be about a page long and clearly address
the question.&nbsp; The questions below are from p 102 of the text:<br>
<br>
1. The overview of this unit mentions that civil institutions were
overlooked in the excitement after the collapse of the former Soviet
Union.&nbsp; On the Internet, find and read Francis Fukuyama's essay,
"The End of History."&nbsp; Do you agree with his
arguments?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does computing have any role to play in the
development of civil institutions?<br>
<br>
2. Napster and its descendents have been much in the news lately.&nbsp;
Do you agree with the recording industry position that downloading
music is copyright infringement?&nbsp; Why or why not?<br>
<br>
3. At least one state has replaced polling places with main-in
voting.&nbsp; The next step would be to replace main-in voting with the
Internet.&nbsp; How would this affect democracy in the United States?<br>
