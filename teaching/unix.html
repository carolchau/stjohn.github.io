<h1>Hints on Using Unix</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This document is intended to familiarize a unix novice with
department's
computers (i.e. <font color="green">emerald</font> for CS 125
and <font color="gold">topaz</font> for CS 117). 
The student is assumed to be sitting in front of a terminal 
in MG122 for CS 125 and in MG110 for CS 117.

<p>
The terminals will be reconfigured, so
that you will be able to work in both rooms.  Terminals with
the old configurations are "hard-wired" to either 
<font color="green">emerald</font> 
or <font color="gold">topaz</font>.  For these, you will see
the name of the computer in the login window, and you can 
follow the directions below.

<p>
For the terminals with the new configuration, you need to
first select your "host" (<font color="green">emerald</font>
for CS 125) from the list.  You may need to scroll down the
list to find it.  Once selected, you can follow the directions
below.


<h2>Login</h2>

If necessary, turn on your terminal and wait for it to warm
up.
<p>
You should see a prompt asking for your login name and
password. Type these carefully, or the computer won't
recognize you. Don't forget to terminate your input with a
carriage return, by pushing the <i>return</i> key. In
general, after you type a command you have to push the
return key.  Otherwise, the computer waits for you to type
more characters.
<p>
(If you're on a graphics terminal or workstation,
eventually, a window will appear. Point at it, with the
mouse, then click the left mouse button to select the
window.)

<h2>The Shell Prompt</h2>

Next, you should see a $, which is the
<i>shell prompt</i>.  A shell is a program that
executes unix commands for you.  You type a command at the
prompt, the shell executes the command for you, and prompts
you for another command. If your prompt is different, don't
worry.

<h2>Directories</h2>

unix stores data in files, and it stores files in
directories. The unix directory structure is like a
tree, with branches and a trunk.  Each branch is named. A
directory name is a slash-separated sequence of branch
names. For example:
<pre>
    /home/faculty/stjohn
</pre>
is the name of the directory in which I store my files
directories.
<p>
To determine the name of your directory, ask the shell to
display (print) your working directory, with the command
pwd (the $ is the prompt, so don't type it):
<pre>
    $ pwd
</pre>
<p>
To make a new directory, you use the command mkdir
followed by the name of your new directory.  Make a
directory to hold the files for your first assignment
by typing:
<pre>
    $ mkdir p1
</pre>
To change directories to the one named p1, you type
<pre>
    $ cd p1
</pre>
If you type cd by itself (not followed by a directory
name), you will return to your home directory.

<h2>Changing Your Password</h2>

To change your password to something somewhat rememberable,
type:
<pre>
    $ passwd
</pre>
You are then prompted to change your password.  Choose a
password with the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>  at least six characters long
<li>  at least two letters
<li>  at least one nonletter
<li>  something you won't forget
</ul>

<h2>Manual Pages</h2>

unix has hundreds of commands. To see the documentation for
a command like ls, use the man command:
<pre>
    $ man ls
</pre>
Notice that man uses a pager like more,
which is actually named less. Press the ``q'' key
to quit.

<h2>Text Editing</h2>

When you write your own programs, you need to create
your own source files. A source file is created and changed
with a program called a text editor. There are several text
editors to choose from. I like vi or gvim.  vi is available
on every unix system.  gvim is a graphics version that 
contains on-line help that extends vi.  
To use gvim, type:
<pre>
    $ gvim test.file
</pre>
To use vi, type:
<pre>
    $ vi test.file
</pre>
To use vi, you need to type the letter ``i'' to insert text
into your file.  When you are done inserting text, or want
to stop to change something, you type the ESC key.  When
you are not in ``inserting'' mode, you can use the arrow keys
to move around the text you have just written.  To save your
file, you type :w and to quit you type :q .  There are many
more things you can do in vi, but these are the essentials
to get you started.
<p>
Another editor is emacs.  It has 
on-line help and a built-in tutorial. To edit files, execute
the following command:
<pre>
    $ emacs &
</pre>

<h2>Printing Files</h2>

To print the content of a file on a printer, you must know
the printer's name.  There are 2 line printers <tt>pr1</tt>
in MG 122 and <tt>pr2</tt> in MG 117.  There will also be a
laser printer (yet to be named). 
To print the content of test.file on
pr1, type:
<pre>
    $ pr test.file | lpr -P pr1
</pre>
The program pr formats the content into pages, the
| <i>pipes</i> the formatted content to
lpr, and lpr prints it. -P
option tells lpr which printer to use.
The printer in MG 110 is named pr2.

<p>
To print from Netscape, you must use the laser printer. 
Until the laser printer is installed, you can print Netscape
documents in the Multipurpose
Classroom Facility general computer
lab or on your home machine.

<h2>Electronic Mail</h2>

The best way to contact me is via electronic mail. Practice
by sending me a message now. Do not indent the message with
spaces or tabs. 
<pre>
    $ mail stjohn
    Subject: A test
    Hello, I'm in your class and wanted
    to try out the email program. 
    Thanks.
    .
    Cc: <i>your-login-here</i>
</pre>
The command mail composes a message from the lines
read from the keyboard, up to a line consisting of only a
dot. It then mails the message to the user named on the
command line, in this case user stjohn. 
The Cc: line allows you to send copies
of the message to other users, such as yourself.
<p>
When you receive mail (perhaps from me), execute
mail to read your mail:
<pre>
    $ mail
</pre>
<p>
You can also use the mail feature of Netscape (if you are
at a graphics termimal or workstation).  To do so,
you will need to alter the Mail Preferences.  If you have
used Netscape mail on other machines, it works the same as 
on other machines.  If you have not used it and would like to, 
please ask for help in setting it up.

<h2>Web Pages</h2>

All handouts for this class are available on the World Wide
Web.  If you are at a graphics terminal, execute the command:
<pre>
    $ netscape &
</pre>
to bring up Netscape, a graphical based web browser.  The
home pages for my classes can be found at:
<br>
<a href="http://math-cs.idbsu.edu/~stjohn/teaching/">
http://math-cs.idbsu.edu/~stjohn/teaching</a>.  You will 
access this page to retrieve homework and annoucements for
class, so, you should "bookmark" the page 
by selecting "Add Bookmark" from the Bookmark menu.  To
return to this page in the future, you can use the Bookmark
menu, instead of typing in the URL above.

<p>
If you are at a text terminal, you can use the web browser,
lynx.  To use lynx, you type the command:
<pre>
    $ lynx http://math-cs.idbsu.edu/~stjohn/teaching
</pre>

<h2>Log Out</h2>

To log out on a text terminal (or of a window on a graphics terminal), use the exit command:
<pre>
    $ exit
</pre>

On a graphics terminal, to log out of the computer, 
point at the root window (i.e.,
the background), click the left mouse button, and select
``Exit FVWM'' (the window manager).
<b>Don't forget to log out when you are done.</b>
