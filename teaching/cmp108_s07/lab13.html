<h3>More on Loops<br>
</h3>
<p>
Today's lab focuses on definite and indefinite loops.&nbsp; We
will be
using the Alice programming environment (<a href="http://www.alice.org">http://www.alice.org</a>).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Design requirements:</b>&nbsp; We will be using one of the
built-in tutorials and the galleries (available on-line or loaded in
from the CD).<br>
</p>
<h3>Animations</h3>
Loops are a standard programming construct and work similarly in Alice
as they did with the robots.&nbsp; Today's programs demonstrate the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Loop</span> construct (much like a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">for</span> loop in NQC) and the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">While</span><br>
construct (almost identical to the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">while</span> loop in NQC).<br>
<br>
For today's lab, do the following animations:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Square bunny hop</span> (Chapter
7, Exercise 2):&nbsp; The main point of this exercise is to have a
creature (bunny or one of your choice), trace out a square.&nbsp; If
you choose the bunny, you can use the method described in Section 7-1
to make the bunny perform one hop.&nbsp; Your creature needs to trace
out (by hopping, walking, driving forward, etc) a side of the square,
then make a quarter turn revolution.&nbsp; As with the robots, this is
then put in a loop.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Frog and Ladybug</span> (Chapter
7, Exercise 5):&nbsp; For this exercise, you need two creatures, one
that is dragged around by the mouse, the other that tries to
follow.&nbsp; You can use the suggested ladybug and frog, or creatures
or your choice.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wind-up Penguin</span> (Chapter
7, Exercise 10):&nbsp; For this animation, a creature (the penguin or
one of your choice) waddles around the world while the wind-up key
turns.&nbsp; Remember that you can set the key's vehicle property to
your creature, so that the key stays with the creature as it moves.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that the animation.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 12:30pm.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 12:15pm, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.<!--
<h3>If you finish early...</h3>

We will be playing basketball in the next lab. The goal is to 
a small object from the starting area, carry it to the basket,
and drop it in.  One approach to this is to use a dump truck,
like the one described in Chapter 9 of the textbook.
