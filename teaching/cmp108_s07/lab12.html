<h3>Functions and If/Else Statements<br>
</h3>
<p>
Today's lab focuses on developing functions and if/else
statements.&nbsp; We
will be
using the Alice programming environment (<a href="http://www.alice.org">http://www.alice.org</a>).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Design requirements:</b>&nbsp; We will be using one of the
built-in tutorials and the galleries (available on-line or loaded in
from the CD).<br>
</p>
<h3>Animations<br>
</h3>
Today's lab has 3 animations<br>
<ul>
  <li>Lightbulb, Exercise 13, p 176</li>
  <li>Does the Shoe Fit, Exercise 16, p 176</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that the animation.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 12:30pm.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 12:15pm, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp;<!--
<h3>If you finish early...</h3>

We will be playing basketball in the next lab. The goal is to 
a small object from the starting area, carry it to the basket,
and drop it in.  One approach to this is to use a dump truck,
like the one described in Chapter 9 of the textbook.
