<h3>HTML</h3>
This lab focuses on basic HTML.&nbsp; The goal is to build a webpage by
the end of the laboratory session. &nbsp; You will use HTML to present
your final robot project as well as animation projects from the second
half the class. <br>
<br>
All material for the class can be found at Prof. Murphy's website:<br>

<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
webpage to Prof. Murphy.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 12:30pm.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 12:15pm, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.<br>
