<h3>Class-level Methods and Interactive Programming<br>
</h3>
<p>
Today's lab focuses on developing class-level methods and demonstrates
programming with keyboard and mouse interaction.&nbsp; We
will be
using the Alice programming environment (<a href="http://www.alice.org">http://www.alice.org</a>).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Design requirements:</b>&nbsp; We will be using one of the
built-in tutorials and the galleries (available on-line or loaded in
from the CD).<br>
</p>
<h3>Class-level Methods and Inheritence<br>
</h3>
Last week, we wrote methods that affected the world.&nbsp; Today, we
will focus on methods for a particular class of objects.&nbsp; First,
work through Tutorial 2 (Bunny and Cellphone) which demonstrates
the use of class-level methods.&nbsp; <br>
<h3>Interactive Programming</h3>
The second half of the today's lecture addressed how to handle events
generated by keyboard and mouse interaction.&nbsp; Work through
Tutorial 3 (Penguins Singing) which demonstrates event-handling in
Alice.&nbsp; The two exercises below use the ideas from the tutorial to
build a typing tutor and an animation that lets you rearrange the
furniture:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Chapter 5, Exercise 4 (Typing Tutor):&nbsp; instead of the word
"Alice," use your name, and only make the letters spin-- no need to
make your whole name spin, and <br>
  </li>
  <li>Chapter 5, Exercise 10 (Furniture Arrangement).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 12:30pm.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 12:15pm, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.
&nbsp; &nbsp;<!--
<h3>If you finish early...</h3>

We will be playing basketball in the next lab. The goal is to 
a small object from the starting area, carry it to the basket,
and drop it in.  One approach to this is to use a dump truck,
like the one described in Chapter 9 of the textbook.
