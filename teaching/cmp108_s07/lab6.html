<h3>Playing Ball<br>
</h3>
Today's lab focues on several simple ways to play ball.&nbsp;
Tasks including "playing catch" and "making goals".&nbsp; Decision, or
<tt>if</tt>-statements, first used in the previous lab,
will be the main programming construct used. <br>
<p><b>Design requirements:</b> This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C. Further, each motor is
attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.). The touch sensor is wired to sensor port 1 and is
connected to a bumper.&nbsp; You might want to invert the bumpers
feelers to make it easier to corner or capture the ball.
</p>
<p><b>Programs used:</b> Today's lab uses the touch sensors and
the <a href="../lsp150/guidenqc/bumpbot1.nqc">bumpbot1.nqc</a> from
lecture.
</p>
<p><b>Lab Set-up:</b> This lab uses a half dozen small balls, and a
small soccer goal.&nbsp; Choose the ball that works best with your
robot configuration.<br>
</p>
<h3>Catching the Ball</h3>
The first task is to write a program that will a sound when a ball hits
the bumper.&nbsp; Depending on how your bumper is set up, choose the
one that hits your bumper the best.&nbsp; This will be a very short
program with the main structure in the program is an <tt>if</tt>-statement.&nbsp;
See the NQC Reference Sheet for the different beeps and tones that the
robots can make.<br>
<br>
Now, take your program and have it repeatedly make a sound when a ball
hits the bumper.&nbsp; Look at how the <a
 href="../lsp150/guidenqc/bumpbot1.nqc">bumpbot1.nqc</a> repeats its
task of backing up when it bumps something, and use that same idea for
your program.
<h3>Throwing the Ball</h3>
The next task is to throw the ball back, after you catch it.&nbsp; To
throw it back, you should back up slightly (to get a running start),
run forward the same amount, and stop abruptly.&nbsp; <br>
<h3>Playing Catch</h3>
Find a partner who has also completed the catching and throwing
program, and set up your robots facing one<br>
another.&nbsp; Gently roll a ball to one of them.&nbsp; The goal is to
have them "play catch": throwing the ball and catching it at least 3
times.&nbsp; You may need to adjust your programs to weaken or
strengthen the robot's throws, so that your partner can catch your
throws.<br>
<br>
<h3>Making Goals</h3>
For the last program, your robot should stand in front of goal (on the
black tape mark) and when a ball is passed to <br>
your robot, it should push/kick the ball into the goal.&nbsp; Your
robot can come close, but should not enter the goal.
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 12:30pm.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 12:15pm, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.
&nbsp; &nbsp;<!--
<h3>If you finish early...</h3>

We will be playing basketball in the next lab. The goal is to 
a small object from the starting area, carry it to the basket,
and drop it in.  One approach to this is to use a dump truck,
like the one described in Chapter 9 of the textbook.
