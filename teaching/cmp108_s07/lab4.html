<h3>Obstacle Course and Touch Sensors</h3>
The first half of the lab focuses on the touch sensor. We will
use the touch sensor as part of a bumper, and count the number of
obstacles that are hit. After a pre-set limit has been reached,
the robot will stop and beep (that is, after too many accidents,
the robot can't drive any more!).
<p>In the second half of today's lab, we'll finish up the obstacle
course from last week's lab.&nbsp; The goal is to design a program to
navigate the obstable course.&nbsp; An optional component is to use the
bumpers to navigate.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Design requirements:</b> This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C. Further, each motor is
attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.).&nbsp; The touch sensor is wired to sensor port 1 and is
connected to a bumper.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Programs used:</b>
Today's lab uses the touch sensors and
the <a href="guidenqc/bumpbot1.nqc">bumpbot1.nqc</a> from lecture.
</p>
<p><b>Lab Set-up:</b> This lab uses an obstacle course set up outside
the lab.<br>
</p>
<h3>The Touch Sensor and Bumpers</h3>
Download the <a href="guidenqc/bumpbot1.nqc">bumpbot1.nqc</a> program
to your robot to test that your bumper is working correctly.&nbsp; Now,
modify the program so that it plays a sound whenever it hits something.<br>
<br>
One natural use for the touch sensor is as part of a bumper.
Wire a bumper to input sensor 1 and try <a href="guidenqc/bumpbot1.nqc">bumpbot1.nqc</a>.
Copy this program to new file called <tt>limited_bumps.nqc</tt>.
Change the program in the following ways, and test between
steps:
<ol>
  <li> First, change <tt>limited_bumps.nqc</tt> to beep everytime it
hits an obstacle. </li>
  <li> Next, declare a variable called <tt>num_obstacles</tt> and set
it to 0. After the touch sensor is bumped, increase the variable by 1
(one command that will do this is: <tt>num_obstacles++;</tt>). </li>
  <li> Change the <tt>while(true)</tt> loop to stop after 5 obstacles
are hit. </li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Modify your program so that <b>only one</b>
constant needs
to be changed to change the number of obstacles you are
allowed to hit before the program stops.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
<h3>Obstacle Course</h3>
There is a simple obstacle course set up outside the lab.
The goal is to have your robot make as many laps
around the course as possible. For future labs, we will use the touch
sensors for the obstacle course. For this lab, you will need to go
solely
by the amount of time that has passed and calculate when to
turn based on time.
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 12:30pm.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 12:15pm, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.
&nbsp;<!--
<h3>If you finish early...</h3>

We will be playing basketball in the next lab. The goal is to 
a small object from the starting area, carry it to the basket,
and drop it in.  One approach to this is to use a dump truck,
like the one described in Chapter 9 of the textbook.
