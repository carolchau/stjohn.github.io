<h3>Animation Programming: Alice<br>
</h3>
<p>
Today's lab is the first on animation programming.&nbsp; We will be
using the Alice programming environment (<a href="http://www.alice.org">http://www.alice.org</a>).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Design requirements:</b>&nbsp; We will be using one of the
built-in tutorials and the galleries (available on-line or loaded in
from the CD).<br>
</p>
<h3>Translating Storyboards to Programs<br>
</h3>
The second chapter focuses on designing programs from translating
storyboards.&nbsp; The exercises below give a story idea to be
implemented as a program.&nbsp; In Chapter 2, <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Complete Chapter 2, Exercise 4 (Circling Fish).&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Complete Chapter 2, Exercise 5 (Tortoise Gets a Cookie).</li>
</ol>
Save the world and demonstrate the world to get credit.<br>
<h3>Programming: Putting the Pieces Together<br>
</h3>
Chapter 3 focuses on programming, using the pieces that have been
discussed, including simple control structures, built-in functions and
expressions. Next, <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Complete Exercise 1 (Robot to Lunar Lander).</li>
  <li>Complete Exercise 3 (Hop).</li>
</ol>
Save the world and demonstrate the world to get credit.
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 12:30pm.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 12:15pm, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.
&nbsp; &nbsp;<!--
<h3>If you finish early...</h3>

We will be playing basketball in the next lab. The goal is to 
a small object from the starting area, carry it to the basket,
and drop it in.  One approach to this is to use a dump truck,
like the one described in Chapter 9 of the textbook.
