<h3>Animation Programming: Alice<br>
</h3>
<p>
Today's lab is the first on animation programming.&nbsp; We will be
using the Alice programming environment (<a href="http://www.alice.org">http://www.alice.org</a>).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Design requirements:</b>&nbsp; We will be using one of the
built-in tutorials and the galleries (available on-line or loaded in
from the CD).<br>
</p>
<h3>Tutorial</h3>
Open the Alice animation system and choose "Open World" from the File
Menu (this should automatically open when you open Alice).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click on the "Tutorial" tab, and choose Tutorial 1.&nbsp; Work through
the entire tutorial.&nbsp; Note more explicit directions on starting
Alice can be found in Appendix A of the textbook.<br>
<h3>Island Scene<br>
</h3>
Next, create an island scene, following the directions for Exercise 1
on p 16. &nbsp; To start a new world, choose the "New World" option
from the File Menu.&nbsp; Save your world (we'll use it later in the
course).
<h3>Winter Snowmen<br>
</h3>
In honor of all the snow we've had, we're now going to build a winter
scene.&nbsp; First, add two snowmen to a snowy scene (see Exercise 2, p
17 for details).&nbsp; Save this, and then modify it to be a snowpeople
pile (see Exercise 3, p 17 for details).<br>
<h3>Finishing up for the Day<br>
</h3>
To get credit for this laboratory, you need to show and explain your
programs to Prof. St. John, as well as demonstrate that they run using
your robot.<br>
<br>
We must be out of the computer laboratory by 12:30pm.&nbsp; As such, if
you
are not ready to demonstrate your work by 12:15pm, you can do so in the
next laboratory.&nbsp; Before leaving the room, make sure that all
computers
and monitors are turned off, that any paper and trash have been
removed, and that all chairs are returned
to their proper places.&nbsp; Also, make sure you pack up your IR tower
in
your shoe box, since they're difficult to replace.
&nbsp; &nbsp;<!--
<h3>If you finish early...</h3>

We will be playing basketball in the next lab. The goal is to 
a small object from the starting area, carry it to the basket,
and drop it in.  One approach to this is to use a dump truck,
like the one described in Chapter 9 of the textbook.
