Fall 2001</h2>

<hr>

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
    <li> <tt>I noticed that you also have an e-mail account on
Lehman's Alpha server. Do you mind if I sent the e-mail to that account,
b/c I can just type your username, or do you want the e-mail sent to the
Comet account ? </tt> 

	<p>
	I check all my email accounts regularly, so, if alpha is easier 
	for you, that's fine.
        <p>

    <li><tt>
	What is the difference between a SUBCLASS and a WEEK
ENTITY is both of them occur when one entity depends
on any attribute of another entity?
	</tt>
	<p>
	Both of these depend on other E.S.'s., but they are 
	different.
	
	<p>
	In E/R diagrams, a weak entity set is an E.S. that depends
	on another E.S. set for its key (example: logins and keys).
	To have a weak entity set, you must have a relationship 
	between it and another E.S.  The supporting relationship
	and E.S. provide the key for the weak E.S.

	<p>
	A subclass is a collection of entities from a given E.S.
	that may have extra properties the original E.S. does
	not have (example: murder-mysteries are a subclass of 
	movies, which have an extra attribute weapon).
	<p>

    <li><tt>I wanted to ask in general, but could we have
    	telnetted into comet and used the psql application to
    	help us solve the SQL problems (or check) in the book ? 
	</tt>

	<p>
	Yes, you can telnet in, and psql will work fine.
	If you have a machine running X Windows (usually
	unix based or a package like ReflectionX installed if
	you're using MS Windows), you can even use pgaccess.
	In general, when you telnet in, it will look just like
	the terminal window you have in the lab.  You won't
	be able to use any graphics programs (like pgaccess or
	some of the editors), but all the text-based commands
	will work fine.

</ol>

<h3>Homework 1</h3>

<ol>
    <li><tt> I was wondering if you accept the assignments typed on a 
	computer; my handwriting & drawing is not the neatest, and neatness 
	may count with the E/R problem with the Amazon "Etailer". But if you 
	prefer I'll write it out</tt>

	<p>
	Typed homework is fine.  For the E/R diagrams, you may want to use
	a drawing program or fill in the boxes by hand.
	<p>

    <li><tt> I'm using Microsoft Word's own flow-charting capabilities 
	to do the assignment. But I do have a question: Does orientation 
	(in terms of placement) matter in the E/R assignments ? 
    	</tt>
    	<p> No, the order that items appear on in the diagram  doesn't matter.  
	<p>

    <li><tt> In addition to the E/R
	diagrams, do I have to show keys, weak entity sets, etc. ?
    	</tt>
    	<p>
	For this assignment, keys and weak entity sets do not need 
	to be identified. 
	<p>

</ol>

<h3>Homework 2</h3>

<ol>
    <li><tt> I have a question about W4. It refers to 2.1.5 on p. 71,
    but I only see 2.5.1c that refers to it. I'm assuming that's
    what you're talking about, right ? If that's the case, which
    problem does this ultimately refer to (can you specifically
    give a page number) ? Is it 2.1.5 on pg. 39 ?</tt>
    <p>
    It should be: W4. Exercise 2.5.1c on p 71 (the part of Exercise
    2.5.1 that refers to 2.1.5).

    <li><tt>>For Problem W4, do you want us to write the whole
    ODL design, including the keys or JUST the keys ?  </tt> 
    <p>
    You need to write out the whole design, since your choice of 
    keys depends on how you design the class.
    <p>
</ol>


<h3>Homework 7</h3>
<ol>
    <li><tt> Re: Problem W19 on Homework #7: For the problems, is it 
	asking to give two different answers to the same problem ? 
	Please clarify.
    </tt>
    <p>Yes, Exercise 5.3.1 asks that you use write two different queries 
	that return the desired information for each part.  One of those 
	should have a subquery in it. 
</ol>

<h3>Exam 2</h3>
<ol>
    <li> <tt>I have a doubt about chapter 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 because
	they talk about Datalog don't they?<br>
	Please let me know if these are sections we are
	responsible for studying since I don't remember going
	over Datalogs.</tt>

	<p>
	If it says "Datalog," you're not responsible for it on the upcoming
	exam.  I'll talk about Datalog and recursion in early December and
	they'll be part of the final.
</ol>
