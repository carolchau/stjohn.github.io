    <li> The second exam is Tuesday, 20 November, from
    	<font color ="red">11-12:50 in Gillet Auditorium.</font>
	Use the basement level entrance the auditorium.  The first
	floor entrance accesses the balcony only.
    <li> It will cover the material in:

    	<li> Chapters 1-6,
	<li> Lecture notes,
	<li> Homeworks 1-8, and
	<li> Handouts from the webpage 
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Exam Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li> The exam is closed book and closed notes.  
    <li> When taking the exam, you may have with you 
    	<ul>
	    <li> an 8 1/2" x 11" (or A4) piece of paper filled with 
	    	notes, programs, etc.  
    	    <li> pens or pencils
	</ul>
    <li> You may not use a computer or calculator.
    <li> All books and bags must be left at the front of
    	the classroom during this exam.  This is to keep 
	the aisles clear, so that I can easily
	reach people to answer questions.
    <li> You must be enrolled in the course to take the exam.
    <li> When you enter the classroom, leave your books and bads at the
	front of the room and find your exam (they are in alphabetic
	order from the front of the room). 
	Write your name on the exam and certify that you understand the
	instructions by initialing each one. <font color="red">Do
	not open the exam</font> until instructed to do so.  This is
	so everyone has the same amount of time to complete
	the exam.
</ul>

<h3>How to Prepare</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Do the assigned reading.
    <li> Make sure you do all the homework that has been 
    	assigned.  The problems (or parts of them) make
	excellent exam questions.
    <li> Work through the practice problems from the 
	homeworks.  These (or variations of them) often
	appear on exams.
    <li> Work through some past exams for other database classes.
	Below are links to exams given by the book's authors.  
	Note that most of their midterms were an hour long and
	covered slightly more material.
