<hr>

<ul>

<li>Written homework should include your name, preferred email, as
well as the assignment number on all pages.

<li> Neatness counts!  If the grader cannot figure out what you are 
saying, you will not get credit.

<li>No late homework will be accepted.  However, programs can be
resubmitted, up to the last laboratory session, to improve your
grade.

<li>Before submitting a program for grading, you should:
<ol>
	<li> Make sure it compiles without errors or warnings.
	<li> Tested your program thoroughly.  Try many different
		inputs, and make sure your program comes up with the 
		right answer.  If test cases are provided, make sure
		program works for those.
    	<li> Include the honesty pledge at the top of each program:
    	<br>
	    I, &lt insert you name here&gt, pledge that this program is<br>
       	    my own indepedent work and conforms to the academic<br>
       	    honor code.<br>

    	<li> Include a comment with your name, your login, and a
    		short description of what your program does.
	<li> Make sure your program is well-documented with comments.
