<h3>Unix Commands</h3>

Each lab begins with several Unix commands that will be useful
for completing today's lab and future labs and assignments.
Try the following commands:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>printenv</tt><br>
	When you log-on on the lab machines, a working environment is
	set up for you.  Your environment includes your username, your
	hostname, the operating system type, the default language (used
	by help files and the keyboard), etc.  To see your current
	environment, type:
<pre> 
    printenv
</pre>

	<li> <tt>grep</tt> <i>pattern [filename]</i><br>
	The <tt>grep</tt> command lets you search for a pattern in 
	standard input or a file.  For example,
<pre>
    printenv | grep PATH
</pre>
	searches the output from the <tt>printenv</tt> command for any
	lines containing the word "PATH."  If you don't specify exactly
	where a program is that you would like to run, the computer first
	checks in all the directories listed in your path.
	
	<li> <tt>which</tt> <i>commandname</i><br>
	When you type name of a program, the computer checks all the 
	directories in your path for that program to run.  Often, you need
	to know which version of the desired program the computer will 
	choose to use.  To do this, use the <tt>which</tt>.  For example,
	if you would like to know which java compiler is used when you
	type <tt>javac</tt>, you type:
<pre>
    which javac
</pre>
	<li> <tt>locate</tt> <i>filename</i><br>
	The <tt>locate</tt> command searches the entire file system for
	the <i>filename</i>.  For example,
<pre>
    locate javac
</pre>
	gives the names of all files that contain "javac" in their complete
	name.  Sometimes, this can be a lot of files and will scroll off
	the screen.  For example, if you type:
<pre>
    locate java
</pre>
	you will see the 1900 files that contain "java" in their name.

<!--
	<li> <tt>&lt; </tt><br>
	<li> <tt>&gt; </tt><br>
	<li> <tt>&gt;&gt; </tt><br>
	<li> <tt>diff</tt> <i>file1 file2</i><br>
	<t>diff</tt> compares two files and reports back any difference.
	This command is very useful for looking small changes in very 
	large files.
-->
</ul>

<h3>Using Java</h3>

Today's lab focuses on using Java on the Linux systems.  Installed on
the lab machines is the Java Developer's Toolkit (JDK 1.2.2), a standard
release from Sun Microsystems.  
<ul>
    <li> Create a directory (or folder) for this lab.
	<br>
	<i>mkdir lab4</i>
	<br>
	(This command creates a new directory called ``lab4''.)
    <li> Use this directory when creating any files for the
    	exercise.  To move to that directory, type:
<pre>
    cd lab4
</pre>
	(This ``changes directories'' to p1.)
	When you create files in the text editor, save them to your
	subdirectory, <tt>lab4</tt>. 
        (To return to your home or main directory, type: <tt>cd </tt>.)

    <li> Create a simple java program that will print <tt>Hello World!</tt>
	as text.  Call the class <tt>Hello</tt> and save the
	file as <tt>Hello.java</tt>.
    <li> To compile the file, type:
<pre>
    javac Hello.java
</pre>
	If there are errors, you will need to edit your program,
	fix them, and compile again.
    <li> To run your program, type:
    	<br>
	<i>java Hello</i>
	<br>
	(The program should say "Hello World!")
</ol>

<h3>Applets</h3>

Now, make an applet that will print "Hello World" in red letters on
a blue background.  As in other systems, you will need to create 
an HTML file for you applet.  Compile your file as before and save
your HTML file as <tt>hello.html</tt>.  To view your applet, you 
can load the webpage into a browser (as you did on other systems), or
you can use a program designed for viewing applets, called 
<tt>appletviewer</tt>.  To use appletviewer, you type:
<pre>
    appletviewer hello.html
</pre>

<p>
Add to your applet, 3 buttons that change the background color. 

<p>
If you have forgotten some of your java, the API's on the 
Sun webpages are at:
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/index.html">
http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/index.html</a>.

<h3>Final Comments</h3>

Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut down your
computer.  First, you should quit all applications.  Then,
go to the <tt>K</tt> menu in the bottom left hand corner and
select <tt>Log Out</tt>.  Choose the <tt>Shut Down</tt> option,
and shut off the monitor when you're done.

<p>
Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer and to
take any personal belongings.  It is difficult to get back
into the lab later (since it's locked when not in use), so,
it's worth making sure you haven't forgotten anything.

<p>
Also, remember to turn in Homework 6 before leaving!

<p>
Next lab, we will focus on designing and compiling Java
programs on an Unix platform.  If you haven't programmed in
Java in sometime, you should review how to write a program that
instantiates objects and has a graphical user interface (GUI).
