<h3>More on Unix</h3>

The Unix operating system has many, useful built-in commands.
The beginning of each lab has several commands that you should
try and make sure you understand how they work:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>man </tt><i>commandname</i><br>
	This is one way to get information about a command.  For
	example, if you would like to know more the command <tt>ls</tt>
	and the possible options, you type:
<pre>
    man ls
</pre>
	How do you get a directory listing, ordered by the last modification
	time of the files?

	<li> <tt>more</tt> <i>filename</i><br>
	This command displays the <i>filename</i> one screenful at a time.
	It's very useful for looking at a file that's longer than 26 lines. 

	<li> <tt>wc</tt> <i>filename</i><br>
	<tt>wc</tt> counts the number of characters, words, and lines in 
	a file.  

	<li> <i>command1</i> | <i>command2</i><br>
	| (pronounced: "pipe") lets you take the output from the first 
	command and send it to input of the next command.  For example, if
	you would like to count the number of items in your directory, you
	could first list your directory and pipe the output into word count:
<pre>
    ls | wc -l
</pre>
	What does the "-l" option do?  
	<p>
	How many student accounts are there on the system?  <br>
	<i>(Hint: if you go up one directory <tt>cd ../</tt>, you will be
	in the student accounts directory.  Count how many accounts are
	there.  After you're done, you can return to your directory by 
	typing: <tt>cd</tt>.)</i>
</ul>

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

Last lab, we used the PostgreSQL (pronounced
"Post-gres-cue-el") database package, via the graphical
interface, <tt>pgaccess</tt>.  To use this interface, you must
be on a machine running unix or the windowing system, called X.
In addition to the machines in this lab, there are 4 machines
in the Student Research Room from which you can directly access
the server <tt>comet</tt> and use <tt>pgaccess</tt> (they're
located along the back wall and say "Unix only" on them).

<p>
Today, we will focus on the text-based interface to PostgreSQL,
called <tt>psql</tt>.  We will be working with the text-based
program for two reasons.  First, you can work with this
interface anywhere, by telnetting into <tt>comet</tt>.  Second,
the commands for the text interface to the database server
are very similar to the commands that will be embedded into
Java programs later in the course.


<p>
Telnet into <tt>comet</tt> and create a database for today's
lab.

<p>
One way to enter the information into your database is to type
in every line by hand.  Another way is to read in the database
stored as a file.  We will use a sample database from
<a href="http://www.archonet.com/pgdocs/chap-exdb.html"</a>PostgreSQL
Notes</a> by Richard Huxton.  First, download or copy the following 
two files into your directory.  If you have netscape running, you
can save the following files to your directory by right clicking
and choosing the "save" option from the menu:
<a href="lab2_tables.txt">lab2_tables.txt</a> and
<a href="lab2_data.txt">lab2_data.txt</a>.
Since you're logged onto <tt>comet</tt>, you can also copy the files 
directly by typing:
<pre>
cp ~stjohn/public_html/teaching/db/lab2_tables.txt .
cp ~stjohn/public_html/teaching/db/lab2_data.txt .
</pre>

<p>
Now that you have the files in your directory, look at what's inside
them using <tt>more</tt>.  The first contains the commands to create
the tables.  The example system involves four main tables: 
<ul>
    <li>companies - which tracks company name and address 

    <li>products - one entry per product with a code and 
	a description 

    <li>orders - with company, product, quantity and order,
	delivery and payment dates 

    <li>diary - which records changes to the other tables in 
	addition to users' notes. 
</ul>
Note that when the tables are created, each attribute is followed
by its type.  The data file has 20 companies, 10 products, 100
orders, and 100 diary entries.

<p>
Next, create your database:
<pre>
    createdb MYNAMElab2
</pre>
where <tt>MYNAME</tt> is your name.

<p>
And read in the file that creates the tables:
<pre>
    psql -f lab2_tables.txt MYNAMElab2
</pre>
and the files that has the data:
<pre>
    psql -f lab2_data.txt MYNAMElab2
</pre>
As these files load, you will see a text message corresponding to
each command as its being executed.  So, this could take a while 
given the size of the data file.

<p>
Now, let's interactively view the database using <tt>psql</tt>.  
First, type
<pre>
psql MYNAMElab2
</pre>
This will run the PostgreSQL interactive sql monitor.  A short
text menu will be displayed to the screen, as well as the name of
the current database to which you are connected.
Type
<pre>
    \?
</pre>
This will list the basic commands and short descriptions of what
they do.
<p>
Type in the command:
<pre>
    \dt
</pre>
This will display the tables in the database.  If you would also 
like to see the attributes of a given table, type
<pre>
    \d tablename
</pre>
where <tt>tablename</tt> is the name of the table you're interested in.

<p>
Now, we're ready to start writing queries.  You can either type the
queries directly in at the <tt>psql</tt> prompt.  Or, you can type
them into a text file (using the text editor of your choice) and 
then load
the file in using the following command at the <tt>psql</tt> prompt:
<pre>
    \i filename
</pre>
where <tt>filename</tt> is the name that contains your queries.

<p>
You must follow every SQL command with a semi-colon (";")-- since 
you can type your queries on multiple lines that is your signal to 
the program that you are finished entering the query.  If you forget
to type the semi-colon, <tt>psql</tt> will wait until you do.

<p>
Try typing the following query:
<pre>
    select co_name from companies;
</pre>
As output, you should see a list of the 20 companies in the database.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

For today's lab, you should write queries that do the following:
<ol>
    <li> prints out the product codes contained in the database
    <li> prints out the product codes and how many have been ordered
	of each.<br>
	<i>(Hint: Group by product code, and sum the quantity 
	ordered.)</i>
    <li> prints out the product codes and the minimum number order,
	the average number ordered, and the maximum number ordered.
	<br>
	<i>(Hint: Group by product code, and use the appropriate
	aggregate operators.)</i>
    <li> prints out the companies, by name, and the products that
	have been ordered from them.  Note that the <tt>orders</tt> 
	table stores the companies by ID numbers, not by names.
</ol>

<h3>Final Comments</h3>

Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut down your
computer.  First, you should quit all applications.  Then,
go to the <tt>K</tt> menu in the bottom left hand corner and
select <tt>Log Out</tt>.  Choose the <tt>Shut Down</tt> option,
and shut off the monitor when you're done.

<p>
Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer and to
take any personal belongings.  It is difficult to get back
into the lab later (since it's locked when not in use), so,
it's worth making sure you haven't forgotten anything.

<p>
Also, remember to turn in Homework 4 before leaving!
