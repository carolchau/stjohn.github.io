<ul>
	<li> <b>Catalog Description:</b>
		CMP 420: Data Base Systems. 4 hours, 4 credits.
		Introduction to theory of data base systems
		and data-base management: theory of relational,
		hierarchical, and network data-base organization, with
		emphasis on the first; views of data, data organization,
		data dependency and redundancy, normal forms, query
		language. A data-base language will be taught and a
		project assigned in that language.  PREREQ: CMP 338.

	<li> <b>Textbook:</b>
		<i>A First Course in Database Systems</i>
		by Ullman and Widom, Prentice Hall, 1997
		(ISBN: 0-13-861337-0). <br>
		(A revised edition will be available October 2001.)	

	<li> <b>Programming Environment:</b> We will be using 
		Postgresql put out by GreatBridge on the Linux Machines.
		More information about using both Linux and Postgresql
		will be available during the first lab session.

	<li> <b>Grading:</b> The grading for the course will be based on:
		<ul>
			<li> Homework & Programs:	20%
			<li> Project:	        	10%
			<li> Midterm Exam 1:		20%
			<li> Midterm Exam 2:		20%
			<li> Final Exam:		30%
		</ul>

	<li> <b>Exams:</b>  The exams will be 
		<ul>
			<li> Midterm Exam 1: Thursday, 11 October 
			<li> Midterm Exam 2: Tuesday, 20 November 
		</ul>
		Since the
		final is comprehensive, if you do better on it than on one
		of the midterm exams, the score on the final may replace
		one of the midterm scores.  Note that the final will be
		long and difficult, so, it is an exceptionally bad idea to
		plan on taking advantage of this.  There will be no makeup
		exams, and you must pass the final to pass the class.

	<li> <b>Assignments:</b> 
		Both the written homework and the programming assignments 
		are available at the class website.   Written homework 
		must be turned in by the due date listed on the homework.

		<br>
		You may turn in programs at any laboratory
		session, but no program will be accepted after the last
		laboratory session of the semester.  If you wish to 
		improve a grade on any program, you may resubmit it
		for grading.
		<br>
		Full credit will only be given for those programs that
		run correctly and have good documentation and
		programming style.

	<li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
		overall design of the programs and homework.  However, for 
		specific
		programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.

	<li> <b>Computer Accounts:</b> You will be assigned a computer 
		account on the Linux machines for work relating to this
		course only.  More information about the computer accounts
		and Linux machines will be available at the first laboratory
		session.
