    <li> All books and bags must be left at the front of
    	the classroom during this exam.  This is to keep 
	the aisles clear, so that I can easily
	reach people to answer questions.
    <li> You must be enrolled in the course to take the exam.
-->    </li><li> When you enter the classroom, you will be given an exam.	You may write your name on the exam, but <font color="red">do	not open it</font> until instructed to do so.  This is	so everyone has the same amount of time to complete	the exam.</li></ul><h3>How to Prepare</h3><ul>    <li> Do the assigned reading.    </li><li> Make sure you do all the problems that have been     	assigned.
