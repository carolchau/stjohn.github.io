Several models of computation 	will be considered.  Topics chosen from: searching and sorting algorithms, algorithms 	on graphs, products involving polynomials and matrices, arithmetic complexity, fast Fourier transform and NP-complete problems.<br>	<i>PREREQ:</i> A course in linear algebra and a course in data structures.		</li><li>  <b>Textbook:</b>		<i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> 		by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, 		McGraw Hill, 2001 (2nd ed). 	</li><li> <b>Programming Environment:</b> You may submit programs in Java, C, C++, or perl.	</li><li> <b>Grading:</b> The grading for the course will be based on:		<ul>			<li> Homework Quizzes:		10%			</li><li> Programming Assignments:		10%			</li><li> Midterm Exam 1:		25%			</li><li> Midterm Exam 2:		25%			</li><li> Final Exam:		30%		</li></ul>	</li><li> <b>Exams:</b>  The exams will be 		<ul>			<li> Midterm Exam 1: Thursday, 3 October 			</li><li> Midterm Exam 2: Thursday, 21 November</li><li>Final: To be announced<br>      </li></ul>		Since the final is comprehensive, if you do better		on it than on one of the midterm exams, the score		on the final may replace one of the midterm scores.		Note that the final will be long and difficult, so, it		is an exceptionally bad idea to plan on taking advantage		of this.  There will be no makeup exams, and you must		pass the final to pass the class.	</li><li> <b>Assignments:</b> 		Homework assignments are posted on the class website.		These are not to be turned in but are the subject of		the quizzes.  More information about the quizzes can be		found <a href="quiz1.html">here</a>.		<br>Programming assignments should be turned in to the digital drop box on Blackboard by the due date listed.		<br>		Full credit will only be given for those programs that		run correctly and have good documentation and		programming style.	</li><li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the		overall design of the programs and homework.  However, for 		specific		programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.		<br>		You are responsible for knowing and following 		Lehman's 		<a href="acadPol.pdf">academic integrity code</a>		in the <a href="http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/programs/graduate.html">Graduate Bulletin</a>.		<br>		All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice		President of Student Affairs.  	</li></ul> <hr>This website for this class is located at: <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/algLehman/">http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/algLehman/</a><hr><br></body></html>
