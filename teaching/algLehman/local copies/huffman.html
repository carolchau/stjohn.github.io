The <b><i>weight</i></b> of a tree is equal to the sum of thefrequencies of its leaves. Assuming that the number of character is C,then C-1 times, select the two trees, T1 and T2, of smallest weight, breakingties arbitrarily, and form a new tree with suntrees T1 and T2. At the beginningof the algorithm, there are C single node trees, one for each character.At the end of the algorithm, there is one tree, and this is the optimalHuffman coding tree. </p><p>The following applet draws the Huffamn tree based on the set of charactersand corresponding frequencies, it also calculates the total number of bitsneeded for both standard coding and Huffman. The Huffman codes are obtainedfrom the Huffman tree. Here standard coding I mean the length of the codefor each character is of the same length.</p><center><p><applet code="HuffmanApplet.class" width="650" height="600"></applet></p></center><p>Tony Xinqing Yin<br>May 2, 1997</p></body></html>
