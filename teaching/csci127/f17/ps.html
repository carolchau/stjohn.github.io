<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description.

	<pre>
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Date: September 1, 2017
#This program prints: hello world

print("Hello, World!")
	</pre>
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before 9pm</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="http://www.gradescope.edu">gradescope</a>, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30%
	of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all 
	incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>

	<li > <b>Due Date: 7 September</b>  <b style="float:right"><a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">Chapters 1 & 4</a></b><br>		
		Write a program that draws an octogon (8-sided polygon).
		<br><br>
		<i>Note:  Choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>. 
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".

	<li > <b>Due Date: 22 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 6</b><br>	

		<a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> focuses on top-down design; that is, beginning with an outline for the <tt>main()</tt> and filling in the  function definitions.
		Fill in the missing function definitions for this program:
	<pre>
import turtle
def main():
	myWin = turtle.Screen()     		#The graphics window
	tristan = turtle.Turtle()		#Tristan will be our turtle for this program
	drawStem(tristan)			#Draw a green stem 	
	for i in range(20):
		drawPetal(tristan,"blue")	#Draws a blue petal for our flower
		drawPetal(tristan,"purple")	#Draws a purple petal for our flower
	myWin.exitonclick()         		#Close the window when clicked	

main()
	</pre>
		That is, write the functions <tt>drawStem()</tt> and <tt>drawPetal()</tt>.  Include all functions, including the <tt>main()</tt> above in the file you submit.
		Sample output of the program:<br>
	<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/flower.jpg">	
		<p >(Note:  you can change the color that your turtle, using the function, <tt>color()</tt>.
		For example, if you turtle is called <tt>tess</tt> to change it's color in <tt>stringColor</tt>,
		write <tt>tess.color(stringColor)</tt>.)	

	<li > <b>Due Date: 23 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 6</b><br>		
	
	
			Complete the following program, which reads in a file that has multiple grades, each separated by a comma, and prints out the computed average. That is, write the functions <tt>getGrades()</tt> and <tt>calculateAverage()</tt>:
<pre>
def main():
      grades = getGrades()   #get the file name containing the grades
                             #and return the contents of the file
      avg = calculateAverage(grades) #separate the grades into numbers and compute
                             #the average
      print("The calculated average is:", avg)
main()
</pre>

			<br>
		<i>Hint:  You may assume that there is one grade per line of the file.  See <a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a>.</i>	
			


	<li > <b>Due Date: 24 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 7</b><br>
	
		The program <a href="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
		<ul>
			<li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward
			<li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
			<li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
			<li> '^':  lifts the pen
			<li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		</ul>
		For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.
		
		<p>
		Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
		<ul>
			<li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards
			<li> 'r':  change the pen color to red			
			<li> 'g':  change the pen color to green
			<li> 'b':  change the pen color to blue
		</ul>		

		<p>Submit your modified program (including a comment at the top of the program with your name).		

	<li > <b>Due Date: 27 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 7</b><br>
	
		Write a function that takes number between 1 and 12 as a parameter and returns the corresponding month as a string.  For example, if the parameter is 1, your function should print out <tt>January</tt>.  If the parameter is 2, your function should print out <tt>February</tt>, etc.

		<p>In your file, you should include a <tt>main()</tt> that allows the user to enter a number and calls your function to demonstrate that it works.		
	

	<li > <b>Due Date: 29 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 7</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user the number of times they plan to ride the subway or bus this week.  Your program should then tell the user if it is cheaper to buy a regular fare (single ride) metro card or  7-day unlimited cards.  (Note: the rates increased as of 15 March 2017).  
		<p>First, compute the cost per ride for the 7-day unlimited metroCard ($31.00 divided by the number of rides) and for the regular fares with bonus.  Next:
		<ul>
			<li> If number of rides is 1 or 2, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a regular ticket.</tt>
			
			<li> If the number of rides is 3 or more, then do the following computation:
			<ul>
				<li> Single cost of ride is $2.48 (cost with bonus for buying more than $5.50).
				<li> 7-day cost of ride is $31.00/number of rides.
			</ul>
			If the single costs is less, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a regular ticket.</tt>
			<p>
			Otherwise, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a 7-day ticket.</tt>
