<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description.

	<pre>
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Date: September 1, 2017
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")
	</pre>
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before 9pm</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in recitation, during tutoring and office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30%
	of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all 
	incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>

	<li > <b>Due Date: 7 September</b>  <b style="float:right"><a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">Think CS: Chapters 1 & 4</a></b><br>		
		Write a program that draws an octogon (8-sided polygon).
		<br><br>
		<i>Note:  Choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>. 
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".

	<li > <b>Due Date: 3 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">Think CS: Chapters ??</a></b><br>	


	
The program <a href="turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
		<ul>
			<li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward
			<li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
			<li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
			<li> '^':  lifts the pen
			<li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		</ul>
		For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.
		
		<p>
		Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
		<ul>
			<li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards
			<li> 'r':  change the pen color to red			
			<li> 'g':  change the pen color to green
			<li> 'b':  change the pen color to blue
		</ul>		
	
		
		<p><i>Hint:  See Lecture 4 notes.</i>

		Write a program that asks the user for a whole number.  If that number is even, your turtle should draw a blue line towards the left hand side of the screen. If that number is odd, your turtle should draw a red line towards the right hand side of the screen.
		
		<br>
		<p><i>Hint:  See <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Selection/ConditionalExecutionBinarySelection.html">Section 7.4</a> of the Python textbook and Lecture 4 notes.</i>

		Write a program that asks the user the number of times they plan to ride the subway or bus this week.  Your program should then tell the user if it is cheaper to buy a regular fare (single ride) metro card or  7-day unlimited cards.  (Note: the rates increased as of 15 March 2017).  
		<p>First, compute the cost per ride for the 7-day unlimited metroCard ($31.00 divided by the number of rides) and for the regular fares with bonus.  Next:
		<ul>
			<li> If number of rides is 1 or 2, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a regular ticket.</tt>
			
			<li> If the number of rides is 3 or more, then do the following computation:
			<ul>
				<li> Single cost of ride is $2.48 (cost with bonus for buying more than $5.50).
				<li> 7-day cost of ride is $31.00/number of rides.
			</ul>
			If the single costs is less, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a regular ticket.</tt>
			<p>
			Otherwise, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a 7-day ticket.</tt>

	<li > <b>Due Date: 22 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 6</b><br>	

		<a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> focuses on top-down design; that is, beginning with an outline for the <tt>main()</tt> and filling in the  function definitions.
		Fill in the missing function definitions for this program:
	<pre>
import turtle
def main():
	myWin = turtle.Screen()     		#The graphics window
	tristan = turtle.Turtle()		#Tristan will be our turtle for this program
	drawStem(tristan)			#Draw a green stem 	
	for i in range(20):
		drawPetal(tristan,"blue")	#Draws a blue petal for our flower
		drawPetal(tristan,"purple")	#Draws a purple petal for our flower
	myWin.exitonclick()         		#Close the window when clicked	

main()
	</pre>
		That is, write the functions <tt>drawStem()</tt> and <tt>drawPetal()</tt>.  Include all functions, including the <tt>main()</tt> above in the file you submit.
		Sample output of the program:<br>
	<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/flower.jpg">	
		<p >(Note:  you can change the color that your turtle, using the function, <tt>color()</tt>.
		For example, if you turtle is called <tt>tess</tt> to change it's color in <tt>stringColor</tt>,
		write <tt>tess.color(stringColor)</tt>.)	

	<li > <b>Due Date: 23 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 6</b><br>		
	
	
			Complete the following program, which reads in a file that has multiple grades, each separated by a comma, and prints out the computed average. That is, write the functions <tt>getGrades()</tt> and <tt>calculateAverage()</tt>:
<pre>
def main():
      grades = getGrades()   #get the file name containing the grades
                             #and return the contents of the file
      avg = calculateAverage(grades) #separate the grades into numbers and compute
                             #the average
      print("The calculated average is:", avg)
main()
</pre>

	<li > <b>Due Date: 9 May</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Intro to R</b><br>		

		Rewrite your program from <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6</a> that graphs shelter census data in R.  Your program should graph the data and also print to the screen (R shell), the minimum, average (mean), and maximum numbers of total individuals in the shelter.

	
	<li > <b>Due Date: 10 May</b>  <b style="float:right">DataCamp Summary Statistics Tutorial</b><br>		

		In <a href="lab12.html">Lab 12</a>, we used <tt>plot()</tt> to create scatter plots and compute summary statistics of our data.   
		
		<p>Write a program that will plot the built-in data set <tt>cars</tt> (car speed and stopping distances recorded in the 1920s.  Your plot should display:
		<ul>
			<li> the speed versus the stopping distance
			<li> the x-axis should be labeled: "Speed"
			<li> the y-axis should be labeled: "Stopping Distance"
			<li> the plot should be labeled:  "Cars Data from 1920's" <br>
			<i>(Hint:  see the <tt>title()</tt> command)</i>, and
			<li> display the average stopping value as an abline.
		</ul>
		
		<p><i>Note:  while computing averages and adding ablines were covered in lecture and tutorials, the adding labels and titles were not.  The purpose of this problem is for you to figure out how to add these using R's help system (i.e. <tt>help(plot)</tt> will give all the options for creating a plot-- read through the options and choose the appropriate ones).</i>

	<li > <b>Due Date: 11 May</b>  <b style="float:right">DataCamp Intro Tutorial</b><br>		

		In <a href="lab12.html">Lab 12</a>, we used plot to create scatter plots.  For example, 
		<pre>
	plot(quakes$long, quakes$lat)
		</pre>
		will plot the built-in dataset of 1000 earthquakes near Fiji.  
		
		<p>Write a program that will make a similar plot using the earthquake observation data collected by the <a href="">US Geological Survey</a>.  
		You can use <a href="4.5_week2017Jan17.csv">this sample file</a> (downloaded in January of quakes magnitude 4.5 or higher) or download current data.  Your program will be quite short and should:
		<ol>
			<li> Read in the CSV file to a data frame.
			<li> Display a scatter plot of the longitude versus the latitude
			of the earthquake observations in the file.
