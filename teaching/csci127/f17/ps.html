<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description.

	<pre>
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Date: September 1, 2017
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")
	</pre>
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before 9pm</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in recitation, during tutoring and office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30%
	of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all 
	incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.

		<p>Write a program that draws an octogon (8-sided polygon).
		<br><br>
		<i>Note:  Choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>. 
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".

		<p>Write a program that asks the user for a name of an image png file, the name of an output file.  Your program should create a new image that has only the blue channel of the original image.
		
		
		<p> A sample run of your program should look like:

	<p> Note:  before submitting your program for grading, remove the commands that show the image (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image).  The program is graded on a server on the cloud and does not have a graphics window, so, the <tt>plt.show()</tt> commands will give an error.  Instead, the files your program produces are compared pixel-by-pixel to the answer to check for correctness.

		Write a program that asks the user for 5 whole (integer) numbers.  For each number, the turtle should move forward that distance, and then turn left 90 degrees.
		
		<p>A sample run of your program should look like:

Enter number:  10
Enter number:  150
Enter number:  73
Enter number:  90

		<p>The program <a href="turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
		<ul>
			<li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward
			<li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
			<li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
			<li> '^':  lifts the pen
			<li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		</ul>
		For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.
		
		<p>
		Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
		<ul>
			<li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards
			<li> 'r':  change the pen color to red			
			<li> 'g':  change the pen color to green
			<li> 'b':  change the pen color to blue
		</ul>

		<p>Write a program that asks the user for a whole number.  If that number is even, your turtle should draw a blue line towards the left hand side of the screen. If that number is odd, your turtle should draw a red line towards the right hand side of the screen.
		
		<br>
		<p><i>Hint:  See <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Selection/ConditionalExecutionBinarySelection.html">Section 7.4</a> of the Python textbook and Lecture 4 notes.</i>

		<p>Modify the flood map of NYC from <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> to color the region of the map with elevation greater than 6 feet and less than or equal 20 feet above sea level the color grey (50% red, 50% green, and 50% blue).

		<p>Write a program that asks the user for the name of a png file and print the number of pixels that are nearly white (the fraction of red, the fraction of green, and the fraction of blue are all above 0.75).

		<p>For example, if your file was of the snow pack in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California in February 2014:
		
		<p>
		<img src="CaliforniaDrought_02232014_md.png" width=300>

		<p> then a sample run would be:
		<pre>
Enter file name:  caDrought2014.png
Snow count is 38010
		</pre>
		
		<p> Note:  for this program, you only need to compute the snow count.  Showing the image will confuse the grading script, since it's only expecting the snow count.  

		<p> <i>Hint: See <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a></i>.

		<p>Write a program that asks the user the number of times they plan to ride the subway or bus this week.  Your program should then tell the user if it is cheaper to buy a regular fare (single ride) metro card or  7-day unlimited cards.  (Note: the rates increased as of 15 March 2017).  
		<p>First, compute the cost per ride for the 7-day unlimited metroCard ($31.00 divided by the number of rides) and for the regular fares with bonus.  Next:
		<ul>
			<li> If number of rides is 1 or 2, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a regular ticket.</tt>
			
			<li> If the number of rides is 3 or more, then do the following computation:
			<ul>
				<li> Single cost of ride is $2.48 (cost with bonus for buying more than $5.50).
				<li> 7-day cost of ride is $31.00/number of rides.
			</ul>
			If the single costs is less, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a regular ticket.</tt>
			<p>
			Otherwise, print out the message:  <tt>You should buy a 7-day ticket.</tt>
		</ul>

 	<p> Here's a sample run of the program:
 <pre>
 How many rides? 2
 You should buy a regular ticket.
 </pre>
	
	
	<p> And another run of the program:
 <pre>
 How many rides? 30
 You should buy a 7-day ticket.
