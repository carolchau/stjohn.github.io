<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description.

	<pre>
#Name: Thomas Hunter
#Date: September 1, 2017
#This program prints: Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")
	</pre>
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before 9pm</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in recitation, during tutoring and office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using <a href="http://www.gradescope.com">gradescope</a>, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (30%
	of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all 
	incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.

		<p>Write a program that draws an octogon (8-sided polygon).
		<br><br>
		<i>Note:  Choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>. 
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program2.py".

	<p> Note:  before submitting your program for grading, remove the commands that show the image (i.e. the ones that pop up the graphics window with the image).  The program is graded on a server on the cloud and does not have a graphics window, so, the <tt>plt.show()</tt> commands will give an error.  Instead, the files your program produces are compared pixel-by-pixel to the answer to check for correctness.

		Write a program that asks the user for 5 whole (integer) numbers.  For each number, the turtle should move forward that distance, and then turn left 90 degrees.

		<p>The program <a href="turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="https://code.org/curriculum/course2/1/Teacher">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
		<ul>
			<li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward
			<li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
			<li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
			<li> '^':  lifts the pen
			<li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		</ul>
		For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.
		
		<p>
		Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
		<ul>
			<li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards
			<li> 'r':  change the pen color to red			
			<li> 'g':  change the pen color to green
			<li> 'b':  change the pen color to blue
		</ul>

		<p>Write a program that asks the user for a whole number.  If that number is even, your turtle should draw a blue line towards the left hand side of the screen. If that number is odd, your turtle should draw a red line towards the right hand side of the screen.

		<p>		Write a function, <tt>monthString()</tt> that takes number between 1 and 12 as a parameter and returns the corresponding month as a string.  For example, if the parameter is 1, your function should return <tt>"January"</tt>.  If the parameter is 2, your function should return out <tt>"February"</tt>, etc.

		<p>In your file, you should include a <tt>main()</tt> that allows the user to enter a number and calls your function to demonstrate that it works.		
		
		<p>Note:  The grading scripts are expecting that your function is called <tt>monthString()</tt>.  You need to use that name, or else it will not be able to find the function and will not get the full points for the program.

		<a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> focuses on top-down design; that is, beginning with an outline for the <tt>main()</tt> and filling in the  function definitions.
		Fill in the missing function definitions for this program:
	<pre>
import turtle
def main():
	myWin = turtle.Screen()     		#The graphics window
	tristan = turtle.Turtle()		#Tristan will be our turtle for this program
	drawStem(tristan)			#Draw a green stem 	
	for i in range(20):
		drawPetal(tristan,"blue")	#Draws a blue petal for our flower
		drawPetal(tristan,"purple")	#Draws a purple petal for our flower
	myWin.exitonclick()         		#Close the window when clicked	

main()
	</pre>
		That is, write the functions <tt>drawStem()</tt> and <tt>drawPetal()</tt>.  Include all functions, including the <tt>main()</tt> above in the file you submit.

		<p>Define a Python function named calculate_tax() which accepts one parameter, income, and returns the income tax. Income is taxed according to the following rule: the first $250,000 is taxed at 40% and any remaining income is taxed at 80%. For example, <tt>calculate_tax(100000)</tt> should return $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000, while <tt>calculate_tax(300000)</tt> should return $250,000 * 0.40 + 50,000 * 0.80 = $140,000.
		
		<p>  In your .py file, you should include a main() that calls your function several times to demonstrate that it works.
