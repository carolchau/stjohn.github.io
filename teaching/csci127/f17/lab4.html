</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
Today's lab will focus on decisions in Python to add contour lines to maps.    

<p>Software tools needed:  terminal (command line), web browser and Python IDLE programming 
environment.

<h3>Using Python, Gradescope, and Blackboard</h3>

<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Python, Gradescope, and Blackboard.

<div>
<h3>Decisions</h3>

<tt>
<ul>
	<li> Color an image using 4 different colors, or text based decision
	<li> Choose something that has enough cases to start with elif's (then drop off if less cases-- conceptually easier)
	<li> Eric's coloring:  black, white, and 2 other colors...
</ul>
</tt>

<p> Extend graph-paper computing...

<!--
<p> <b> Use in lab with if-statements</b>
Compute the complement of DNA strand- include images from wiki.  Instead of if-statements, use string methods to replace each letter.  Translate to lower case (to avoid translate items twice), then use upper case to make it look the same as input format.
-->


</div>

<div>
<h3> More on Files & Command Line Interface</h3>

Include one or two more commands from labs 3 onward...
</div>

<div>
<h3>Contour Lines</h3>

<tt>
<ul>
	<li> Use nifty program or R example-- need to find data sets with contour lines
	<li> For program:  have students make a weather map, coloring in fronts?
</ul>
</tt>


</div>

<div>
<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a quiz on the academic integrity policy of City University of New York.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.  To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Blackboard).

</div>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
