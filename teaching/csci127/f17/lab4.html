<h2>Lab 4<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2017<br><br>
</h2>

<div>

<p>
Today's lab will focus on decisions in Python to add contour lines to maps.    

<p>Software tools needed:  terminal (command line), web browser and Python IDLE programming 
environment.

<h3>Using Python, Gradescope, and Blackboard</h3>

<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Python, Gradescope, and Blackboard.

<h3>Decisions</h3>

<tt>
<ul>
	<li> Color an image using 4 different colors, or text based decision
	<li> Choose something that has enough cases to start with elif's (then drop off if less cases-- conceptually easier)
	<li> Eric's coloring:  black, white, and 2 other colors...
</ul>
</tt>

<p> Extend graph-paper computing...

<!--
<p> <b> Use in lab with if-statements</b>
Compute the complement of DNA strand- include images from wiki.  Instead of if-statements, use string methods to replace each letter.  Translate to lower case (to avoid translate items twice), then use upper case to make it look the same as input format.
-->


</div>

<div>
<h3>Getting Numbers as Input</h3>

The Python <tt>input</tt> command returns strings, even if the characters in the string are numbers.  To use the characters as numbers, we need convert the string to a number.  There are several built-in functions to help with this:

<div>
<h3> More on Files & Command Line Interface</h3>

Include one or two more commands from labs 3 onward...
</div>

<div>
<h3>Contour Lines</h3>

<tt>
<ul>
	<li> Use nifty program or R example-- need to find data sets with contour lines
	<li> For program:  have students make a weather map, coloring in fronts?
</ul>
</tt>

<h4>Landsat Satellite Data</h4>

<p>
Landsat Satellite Program is a joint program of USGS and NASA that has provided continuous images of the earth since 1972. The data is publicly available through the USGS-EROS site and has been invaluable in mapping changes in the earth. Today, we will use data images from the USGS remote sensing gallery:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/gallery/">http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/gallery/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
The gallery consists usually of pairs of images demonstrating change over time.
Our challenges for today are:
<ul>
	<li> California drought: how much change has their been in the Sierra Nevada snowpack during the current drought?
	there are three images of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Count the amount of snow cover (pixels that are nearly white) in the image from 
	<a href="CaliforniaDrought_02232011_md.png">February 2011</a>. Then count the snow cover in 
	<a href="CaliforniaDrought_02122013_md.png">February 2013</a> and in 
	<a href="CaliforniaDrought_02232014_md.png">February 2014</a>. What is the percentage coverage (using 2011 as a baseline)?  
	<li> Korean Coastline: how much has the coastline of Incheon, South Korean grown over the last 30 years? In the last 32 years, the land region around Incheon, South Korea has grown significantly. Using <a href=
	http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/gallery/gallery.php?cat=3#353
	>the images</a> in the gallery from <a href="Incheon_09051981_sm.png">1981</a> and <a href="Incheon_09162013_sm.png">2013</a>, highlight in red the additional land mass.<br> (Hint: subtract the two images to find the regions that are different. Next, add in an if-statement inside your loop to color only those regions red.)
	<li> Choose an image set from the gallery, develop a hypothesis, and design a program to analyse your image. <br>
	Note: Some images are stored in JPG format-- use Preview to convert to PNG.  
</ul>

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a <a href="quizzes.html">quiz</a>.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.  To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Blackboard).

</div>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
