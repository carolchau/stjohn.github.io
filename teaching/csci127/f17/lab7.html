<h3>Using NYC OpenData</h3>

<p>
Much of the data collected by city agencies is publicly available at 
<a href="http://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">NYC Open Data</a>.  Let's use pandas to plot some data from NYC OpenData.

<p>
<img src="shelterTotal.png" height=400>

<p> We'll start with data that has the daily number of families and individuals residing in the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) shelter system:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/DHS-Daily-Report/k46n-sa2m">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/DHS-Daily-Report/k46n-sa2m</a>
</ul>

<p>
Click on the "View Data" button.  To keep the data set from being very large (and avoid some missing values in 2014), we are going filter the data to be all counts after January 1, 2015.  To do this:
<ul>
	<li> Click on the "Filter" button.
	<li> On the menu that pops us, click on "Add a New Filter Condition".
	<li> Choose "Date of Census" but change the "is" to be "is after".
	<li> Click in the box below and a calendar will pop up.  Highlight January 1, 2015.
	<li> Click the check box to the left of the data.  
	<li> It will take a few seconds (it's a large file) but the rows on the left 
	will be filtered to be all counts after January 1, 2015.
</ul>
To download the file, 
<ul>
	<li> Click on the "Export" button.
	<li> Under "Download", choose "CSV".
	<li> The download will begin automatically (files are usually stored in "Downloads" folder).
</ul>

<p>
Move your CSV file to the directory that you save your programs.  Open with Excel (or your favorite spreadsheet program) to make sure it downloaded correctly.  Look at the names of the columns since those will correspond to series we can plot.

<p> Now, we can write a (short) program to display daily counts:
<pre>
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

homeless = pd.read_csv("DHS_Daily_Report.csv")
homeless.plot(x = "Date of Census", y = "Total Individuals in Shelter")
plt.show()
</pre>

Save your program and try on your dataset.


<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ul>
	<li> What happens if you leave off the <tt>y = "Total Individuals in Shelter"</tt>?
	<li> Display a plot that shows the fraction of the total population that is familes, over time.  Is it increasing or decreasing?
	<li> How can you save your plot to file?  (Hint:  See <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6</a>.)
</ul>

</div>

<div>
<h3>github</h3>

<a href="https://github.com">github</a> is the standard way to share and collaborate on code.  It functions much as Google docs does for documents.
We will use it as a place (<b>repository</b> or "repo") for programs and lab exercises.

<ol>
	<li> If you do not already have an account, create an account on <a href="https://github.com">github</a>.  <tt>github</tt> will be used in future classes (and by employers), so, choose an account name that you can use for years to come.
	<li> Work through the <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1">github for beginners</a> tutorial.
	<li> Work through the 
		<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">github Hello World</a> tutorial.
</ol>

</div>

<div>
<h3><tt>main()</tt></h3>

<p>Python allows you to write programs as scripts: basically, a list of commands that are executed one after the other.  You can also organize the programs in functions, which groups commands together that can be reused.  Many programming languages (like C++ or Java) require that your programs be organized in functions.


<p>To define function in Python, we use the <tt>def</tt> command, which has the basic form:

<pre>
def myFunction(input1, input2, ...):
    command1
    command2 
    ...
</pre>
Note that everything indented below the <tt>def</tt> line is considered part of the function.  When you type the function name (followed by parenthesis), it calls the function, which means it executes all the commands, one after another, that are part of the function.

<p>Let's rewrite our first program, using functions.  By tradition (and since it matches the naming protoccol of C & C++), we will call our function <tt>main()</tt> (see <a href="https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Functions/mainfunction.html">Section 6.7:  Using a Main Function</a>):

<pre>
#Name:  your name here
#Date:  October 2017
#This program, uses functions, says hello to the world!

def main():
    print("Hello, World!") 
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</pre>

In Python, we have the option of running our programs as a standalone program, or included as module as part of another program.  Since it's common to do either, we include the last two lines of the file, which say if the program is being run directly (which we can test to see if the variable <tt>__name__</tt> that is set by Python is <tt>__main__</tt>), then we call <tt>main()</tt>.  If it's not, then the file is being included in something else, and leaves it to that program to call it.

<p> Save your program and try running it in IDLE.

<p> Now, at the prompt (the window with the lines beginning with <tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt>), type <tt>main()</tt>.  This calls the function directly.  Note that calling the function either way results in the same actions:  the commands inside <tt>main()</tt> are executed.

<p>
When you have a running version, see the <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a>.

<h3>Finding Errors</h3>

Finding, and fixing errors, in your programs is a very useful skill.  Let's look at a program with lots of errors and work through how to identify the issues and fix them.  The program, <a href="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py">errors.py</a>, when loaded into IDLE does not run:
<pre># errors.py is based on dateconvert2.py from Chapter 5 of the Zelle textbook
#     Converts day month and year numbers into two date formats

def main()
    # get the day month and year
    day, month year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")

    date1 = str(month)"/"+str(day)+"/"+str(year)

    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", 
              "May", "June", "July", "August", 
              "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    monthStr = months[month+1]
    date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)

    print("The date is" date1, "or", date2+".")

main()
</pre>
Instead, a dialog box pops up and says "invalid syntax":<br>
<br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow1.jpg">
<br>

<p>The red line indicates where the intepreter has found an error.  Can you tell what it is?  Syntax is another word for grammar, so, it most likely missing `punctuation' or a misspelling of some sort.  We have spelled <tt>def</tt> correctly and have the right number of parenthesis, so, what else is missing?

<p>The answer is after the parenthesis on a function definition, a colon is required.  Add that in:
<pre>
    def main():
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow2.jpg"><br>
<br>Instead of the whole line being highlighted, only the word <tt>year</tt> is.  The Python intepreter was not expecting <tt>year</tt> and says there is a grammatical mistake.  Since <tt>year</tt> does not include any grammatical constructs, we need to look <i>before</i> the message to see where the error is.  
Do you see it?

<p>The answer is lists of variables need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre>
    day, month, year = ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Once more we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow3.jpg"><br>

<p>It has highlighted the first item, <tt>date1</tt> on the line.  That is a name and looks fine.  So, as above, let's look before the highlighted error to see if there's a problem.  The line above it is:
<pre>
    day, month, year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")
</pre>
It did not highlight this line, so, the problem must be at the end.  Do you see it?  

<p>The answer is we are missing a closing parenthesis.  The line has two left parenthesis but only one right parenthesis.  Add the right parenthesis in:
<pre>
    ... and year numbers: "))
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow4.jpg"><br>

<p>The intepreter does not understand the second " on the line.  Why?  What is this line doing?  It's constructing a string and storing it in the variable <tt>date1</tt>.  How do you build a string out of smaller strings?

<p>The answer is to put smaller strings together (called concatenation) we need to use the plus sign (+).  The line is missing a plus sign right before the quotes.  Add the plus sign in:
<pre>
    date1 = str(month) + "/" ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box, but this one has a different message:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow5.jpg"><br>

<p><tt>EOL</tt> means "End of the line", so, the message says that the end of the line was reached before you finished defining the string.  How can you fix this?

<p>The answer is to end the string, using quotation marks.  The line is missing a quotation mark at the very end.  Add the quotation mark :
<pre>
    ...+ ",  + str(year)"
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Our familiar dialog box returns:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow6.jpg"><br>

<p>We have seen this type of error before.  How do you fix it?

<p>The answer is lists of arguments need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre>
    ... date is", date1 ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It runs!  Now let's make sure it works.  Type in at the prompt:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
</pre>
Uh oh, instead of output, we get the following messages:
<pre style = "color: red">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 18, in <module>
    main()
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 13, in main
    monthStr = months[month+1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
<p>When you see messages like this, go to the very last line:
<pre style = "color: red">
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
It says that the index for our list is out of range.  An index is the item of the list that we're accessing.  For example, <tt>months[1]</tt> has index <tt>1</tt> and will give us <tt>February</tt>.  The range of the index for a list is <tt>0</tt> to one less than the length of the list.  In the case of <tt>months</tt>, the range is <tt>[0,1,2,...,11]</tt>.  What went wrong when we entered <tt>12</tt> for our month?  


<p>The answer is we used <tt>month+1 = 12 + 1 = 13</tt> as the index:
<pre>
    monthStr = months[month+1]
</pre>
which is out of range.  What do we want instead?  Instead of adding <tt>1</tt>, we should subtract <tt>1</tt>.  Change it in the program:
<pre>
    monthStr = months[month-1]
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It still runs, but does it work?  Let's try the same input again:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
The date is 12/31/14 or December 31,  + str(year).
</pre>

<p>Something odd is happening at the end-- <tt>str(year)</tt> does not look right.  Let's look at the print statement:
<pre>
date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)"
</pre>
The intepreter is treating <tt>",  + str(year)"</tt> as a string (instead of evaluating <tt>str(year)</tt>), so, we must have put the quotation mark in the wrong place before.  Let's move it:
<pre>
date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ","  + str(year)
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Success!  But try a few other inputs, just to make sure.  It is always good to try cases that are near the `boundary' of what's allowed, since those are the places we are most likely to make mistakes:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1,1,2015
The date is 1/1/2015 or January 1,2015.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1, 2, 2003
The date is 2/1/03 or February 1,2003.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 4, 7, 1976
The date is 7/4/1976 or July 4,1976.
</pre>

<p>We have removed all the errors, and the program now runs correctly!
