<h3>Plotting from Files</h3>

<p>  
We can combine the mapping of folium with the tools we have used for CSV files.
We introduced <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a> in <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6</a>.  We'll use it here to read in large CSV files and then make maps of the GIS data inside the files.



We can combine the mapping of folium with the tools we have used for CSV files.

<p>Let's make an interactive map of the the CUNY campuses.  Instead of typing every location in by hand, we can use a file.   First, download a CSV file from data.ny.gov:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Education/City-University-of-New-York-CUNY-University-Campus/i5b5-imzn/data">CUNY Campuses</a>
</ul>
(Export as a <b>.csv</b> file and save in the same directory as your programs.) Open the file to make sure you have all the lines (should be 23) and to check if the column headings occur in the first row (they do, so no need to skip rows when reading in the file).  

<p>
Let's use Pandas to read in the file.  We will need to import pandas and folium:
<pre>import folium
from folium.plugins import MarkerCluster
import pandas as pd
</pre>
Note that we're explicitly importing MarkerCluster from the Folium plugins (we're going to use it to cluster markers together as the map zooms out).



<p>To read in the CSV file, we'll use pandas' csv reader.  We'll print out the campus locations to make sure that all were read in:
<pre>
cuny = pd.read_csv('cunyLocations.csv')
print (cuny["Campus"])
</pre>

<p>Next, let's set up a map, centered on New York City:
<pre>
mapCUNY = folium.Map(location=[40.75, -74.125])
</pre>

<p>
We need to add markers for each campus.  First, we'll create empty lists to hold the locations, the popup messages, and the icons:
<pre>
#Create lists to hold coordinates and popups:
coords = []
popups = []
icons = []
</pre>

We're going to iterate through the rows of dataframe to create the markers:
<pre>
#For each row in the CSV file:
for index,row in cuny.iterrows():
    #Extract the data:
    lat = row["Latitude"]
    lon = row["Longitude"]
    name = row["Campus"]
    #Add the [lat,lon] to list of coordinates:
    coords.append([lat,lon])
    #Add the names to the popup list>
    popups.append(name)
    if row["College or Institution Type"] == "Senior Colleges":
        icons.append(folium.Icon(icon='cloud'))
    else:
        icons.append(folium.Icon(color='green'))
</pre>
Note that we're putting in different icons, depending on whether its a senior college or not.

<p>Once we have everything set up, let's add all the markers at once:
<pre>
#Add all the markers at once:
mapCUNY.add_children(MarkerCluster(locations=coords, popups = popups, icons=icons))
</pre>

<p>Lastly, let's save our map:
<pre>
mapCUNY.save(outfile='cunyLocations.html')
</pre>

<p>
To view your map, open a browser.  From the browser, open the file:  <tt>cunyLocations.html</tt>.

<h3>Finding Errors</h3>

Finding, and fixing errors, in your programs is a very useful skill.  Let's look at a program with lots of errors and work through how to identify the issues and fix them.  The program, <a href="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py">errors.py</a>, when loaded into IDLE does not run:
<pre># errors.py is based on dateconvert2.py from Chapter 5 of the Zelle textbook
#     Converts day month and year numbers into two date formats

def main()
    # get the day month and year
    day, month year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")

    date1 = str(month)"/"+str(day)+"/"+str(year)

    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", 
              "May", "June", "July", "August", 
              "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    monthStr = months[month+1]
    date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)

    print("The date is" date1, "or", date2+".")

main()
</pre>
Instead, a dialog box pops up and says "invalid syntax":<br>
<br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow1.jpg">
<br>

<p>The red line indicates where the intepreter has found an error.  Can you tell what it is?  Syntax is another word for grammar, so, it most likely missing `punctuation' or a misspelling of some sort.  We have spelled <tt>def</tt> correctly and have the right number of parenthesis, so, what else is missing?

<p>The answer is after the parenthesis on a function definition, a colon is required.  Add that in:
<pre>
    def main():
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow2.jpg"><br>
<br>Instead of the whole line being highlighted, only the word <tt>year</tt> is.  The Python intepreter was not expecting <tt>year</tt> and says there is a grammatical mistake.  Since <tt>year</tt> does not include any grammatical constructs, we need to look <i>before</i> the message to see where the error is.  
Do you see it?

<p>The answer is lists of variables need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre>
    day, month, year = ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Once more we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow3.jpg"><br>

<p>It has highlighted the first item, <tt>date1</tt> on the line.  That is a name and looks fine.  So, as above, let's look before the highlighted error to see if there's a problem.  The line above it is:
<pre>
    day, month, year = eval(input("Please enter day, month, and year numbers: ")
</pre>
It did not highlight this line, so, the problem must be at the end.  Do you see it?  

<p>The answer is we are missing a closing parenthesis.  The line has two left parenthesis but only one right parenthesis.  Add the right parenthesis in:
<pre>
    ... and year numbers: "))
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow4.jpg"><br>

<p>The intepreter does not understand the second " on the line.  Why?  What is this line doing?  It's constructing a string and storing it in the variable <tt>date1</tt>.  How do you build a string out of smaller strings?

<p>The answer is to put smaller strings together (called concatenation) we need to use the plus sign (+).  The line is missing a plus sign right before the quotes.  Add the plus sign in:
<pre>
    date1 = str(month) + "/" ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Again, we get a dialog box, but this one has a different message:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow5.jpg"><br>

<p><tt>EOL</tt> means "End of the line", so, the message says that the end of the line was reached before you finished defining the string.  How can you fix this?

<p>The answer is to end the string, using quotation marks.  The line is missing a quotation mark at the very end.  Add the quotation mark :
<pre>
    ...+ ",  + str(year)"
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>
Our familiar dialog box returns:<br><br>
<img src="../../cmp/cmp230/f14/errorWindow6.jpg"><br>

<p>We have seen this type of error before.  How do you fix it?

<p>The answer is lists of arguments need commas in between them to distinguish one from the next.  Add the comma in:
<pre>
    ... date is", date1 ...
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It runs!  Now let's make sure it works.  Type in at the prompt:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
</pre>
Uh oh, instead of output, we get the following messages:
<pre style = "color: red">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 18, in <module>
    main()
  File "/Users/stjohn/public_html/teaching/cmp/cmp230/f14/errors.py", line 13, in main
    monthStr = months[month+1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
<p>When you see messages like this, go to the very last line:
<pre style = "color: red">
IndexError: list index out of range
</pre>
It says that the index for our list is out of range.  An index is the item of the list that we're accessing.  For example, <tt>months[1]</tt> has index <tt>1</tt> and will give us <tt>February</tt>.  The range of the index for a list is <tt>0</tt> to one less than the length of the list.  In the case of <tt>months</tt>, the range is <tt>[0,1,2,...,11]</tt>.  What went wrong when we entered <tt>12</tt> for our month?  


<p>The answer is we used <tt>month+1 = 12 + 1 = 13</tt> as the index:
<pre>
    monthStr = months[month+1]
</pre>
which is out of range.  What do we want instead?  Instead of adding <tt>1</tt>, we should subtract <tt>1</tt>.  Change it in the program:
<pre>
    monthStr = months[month-1]
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>It still runs, but does it work?  Let's try the same input again:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 31, 12, 2014
The date is 12/31/14 or December 31,  + str(year).
</pre>

<p>Something odd is happening at the end-- <tt>str(year)</tt> does not look right.  Let's look at the print statement:
<pre>
date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ",  + str(year)"
</pre>
The intepreter is treating <tt>",  + str(year)"</tt> as a string (instead of evaluating <tt>str(year)</tt>), so, we must have put the quotation mark in the wrong place before.  Let's move it:
<pre>
date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ","  + str(year)
</pre>
and try to run the program again.

<p>Success!  But try a few other inputs, just to make sure.  It is always good to try cases that are near the `boundary' of what's allowed, since those are the places we are most likely to make mistakes:
<pre>
Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1,1,2015
The date is 1/1/2015 or January 1,2015.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 1, 2, 2003
The date is 2/1/03 or February 1,2003.

Please enter day, month, and year numbers: 4, 7, 1976
The date is 7/4/1976 or July 4,1976.
</pre>

<p>We have removed all the errors, and the program now runs correctly!
