<h3>Logical Expressions</h3>

<p> Last week, we introduced decisions (if-statements).  These relied on the "test" which was an expression that evaluated to true or false.  

<p> We can build up more complicated logical expressions using built-in operators, <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and </tt>not</tt>.

<p>
<table border="1px">
	<tr>
		<th><tt>in1</tt></th> <th><tt>in2</tt></th> <th><tt>in1 and in2</tt></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>True</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>True</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>False</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>False</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>	
</table>

<p>Similarly for <tt>or</tt>:
<table border="1px">
	<tr>
		<th><tt>in1</tt></th> <th><tt>in2</tt></th> <th><tt>in1 or in2</tt></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>True</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>True</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>False</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>False</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>	
</table>

<p> The <tt>not</tt> operator changes the input from false to true, or true to false.  That is, <tt>not True</tt> is false and <tt>not False</tt> is true.  We can write this in the table format above:

<p>
<table border="1px">
	<tr>
		<th><tt>in1</tt></th> <th><tt>not in1</tt></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>	
</table>


<tt>
<ul>
	<li> Add more explanation
	<li> Give an example of combining statements

</ul>
</tt>


</div>


<div>
<h3>Logical Circuits</h3>

<p>The logical expressions above are useful not only in designing decisions and selecting data in Python, but the same concept underlies much of the hardware of computers.  The <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and <tt>not</tt>.

<p>
Image of hardware

<p>

<p>
Do majority of 3 inputs

<p>
Add two digit numbers with carry,

<h3> More on the Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>
In <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, we introduced the shell, or command line, commands to create new directories (folders) and how to list the contents of those folders.  We can take those commands and store them in a file to be used
later.

<p>
It's a bit archaic, but we can create the file with the <tt>vi</tt> editor.   It 
dates back to the early days of the Unix operating system.  It has the advantage that it's integrated into the operating system and guaranteed to be there.  It is worth trying at least once (so if you're in a bind and need to edit unix files remotely, you can), but if you hate it (which is likely), use the graphical gedit (you can find it via the search icon on the left hand menu bar).

<p>
Let's create a simple shell script with <tt>vi</tt>:
<ol>
	<li> Open a terminal window.
	<li> Type in the terminal window:  <tt>vi setupProject</tt>
	<li> To add text to the file, begin by typing <tt>i</tt> (the letter i)
	which stands for "insert"
	<li> Type the lines:
	<pre>
mkdir projectFiles
cd projectFiles
mkdir source
mkdir data
mkdir results
	</pre>
	<li> Click on the ESC (escape key-- usually on the upper row of keys) which escapes from insert mode.
	<li> Type:  <tt>:wq</tt> which stands for "write my file" and "quit" (the ":" is necessary-- it tells vi that you want to use the menu commands).
	<li> This brings us back to the terminal window.  
	Type <tt>ls</tt> to see a listing of the directory, which should include the file,
	<tt>setupProject</tt>, you just created.
	<li> Next, we'll change the permissions on the file, so that we can run it directly, by just typing its name:
	<pre>
chmod +x setupProject
	</pre>
	(changes the "mode" to be executable).
	
	<li> To run your first shell script, you can now type its name at the terminal:
	<pre>
./setupProject
	</pre>
	<li> Check to see that your script works, type <tt>ls</tt> to see the new directories your script you created.
	<li>
</ol>


<p>Include one or two more commands from labs 3 onward...

<p> sh-bang line?

<p> Troubles with vi?  It's not intuitive-- here's some cheat sheets.  If you hate it, just edit using gEdit (the Linux version of TextEdit) or IDLE.


<p>Command line script:  Using Unix shell commands, create a directory, <tt>projectFiles</tt>.  The directory should contain three subdirectories:  <tt>source</tt>, <tt>data</tt>, and <tt>results</tt>, as well as a <tt>README</tt> file.  The subdirectories will be empty, but the <tt>README</tt> file should contain the message:  "This project is organized with code (in source), data, and output from the computations (in results)."
		
<p>All of your commands should be in a single text or shell file.

<h3>Slicing Strings, Lists, & Arrays</h3>

<p>
In lecture, we have been discussing <tt>range()</tt> and slicing of strings, lists, and arrays.  Let's work through an example both to recap and pull all these ideas together.

<p>
Recap indexing, link slicing to range, give examples with just lists and strings.

<p>
Same idea works for arrays (they even have a step!)
<p>
Explain slices and indexing, take an image and add a border to it.

<p>In addition to selecting individual "slices" of the , we can actually select regions of the image to manipulate.  Our image above, has 287 rows, 573 columns, and 4 color channels (for red, green, blue, and a fourth channel for luminosity or how transparent the image is).  
Add in:
<ul>
	<li> Also cut the image in 1/2
	
img[:img.height/2,:,:]


	
	<li> Then the upper quarter
	<li> Give it a border-- make it black, turn to purple?
	<li> print(img.shape)  print(img.shape)
	<li> Can traverse an image pixel by pixel-- explain slicing?
	<li> Count pixels that are snow-- CA drought images?



</ul>

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a <a href="quizzes.html">quiz</a>.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.  To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Blackboard).

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
