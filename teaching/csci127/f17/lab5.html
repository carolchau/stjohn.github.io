<h2>Lab 5<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2017<br><br>
</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
Today's lab will focus on logical expressions and circuits.  

<p>Software tools needed:  web browser and Python IDLE programming 
environment.

<h3>Using Python, Gradescope, and Blackboard</h3>

<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Python, Gradescope, and Blackboard.

<div>
<h3> More on Files & Command Line Interface</h3>

Include one or two more commands from labs 3 onward...

<p>Command line script:  Using Unix shell commands, create a directory, <tt>projectFiles</tt>.  The directory should contain three subdirectories:  <tt>source</tt>, <tt>data</tt>, and <tt>results</tt>, as well as a <tt>README</tt> file.  The subdirectories will be empty, but the <tt>README</tt> file should contain the message:  "This project is organized with code (in source), data, and output from the computations (in results)."
		
<p>All of your commands should be in a single text or shell file.  
		
</div>


<div>
<h3>Logical Expressions</h3>

<tt>
<ul>
	<li> Truth tables for ANDs and ORs.
	<li> Combining statements

</ul>
</tt>


<!--
<p> <b> Use in lab with if-statements</b>
Compute the complement of DNA strand- include images from wiki.  Instead of if-statements, use string methods to replace each letter.  Translate to lower case (to avoid translate items twice), then use upper case to make it look the same as input format.
-->

<h4>More Details on Images</h4>

Here or next lab?

<p>
Explain slices and indexing, take an image and add a border to it.

<p>In addition to selecting individual "slices" of the , we can actually select regions of the image to manipulate.  Our image above, has 287 rows, 573 columns, and 4 color channels (for red, green, blue, and a fourth channel for luminosity or how transparent the image is).  
Add in:
<ul>
	<li> Also cut the image in 1/2
	
img[:img.height/2,:,:]


	
	<li> Then the upper quarter
	<li> Give it a border-- make it black, turn to purple?
	<li> print(img.shape)  print(img.shape)
	<li> Can traverse an image pixel by pixel-- explain slicing?
	<li> Count pixels that are snow-- CA drought images?



</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a <a href="quizzes.html">quiz</a>.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.  To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Blackboard).

</div>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
