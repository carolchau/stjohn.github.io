<h3>Logical Expressions</h3>

<p> Last week, we introduced decisions (if-statements).  These relied on the "test" which was an expression that evaluated to true or false.  

<p> We can build up more complicated logical expressions using built-in operators, <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and </tt>not</tt>.

<p>
<table border="1px">
	<tr>
		<th><tt>in1</tt></th> <th><tt>in2</tt></th> <th><tt>in1 and in2</tt></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>True</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>True</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>False</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>False</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>	
</table>

<p>Similarly for <tt>or</tt>:
<table border="1px">
	<tr>
		<th><tt>in1</tt></th> <th><tt>in2</tt></th> <th><tt>in1 or in2</tt></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>True</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>True</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>False</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>False</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>	
</table>

<p> The <tt>not</tt> operator changes the input from false to true, or true to false.  That is, <tt>not True</tt> is false and <tt>not False</tt> is true.  We can write this in the table format above:

<p>
<table border="1px">
	<tr>
		<th><tt>in1</tt></th> <th><tt>not in1</tt></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>True</td><td>False</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>False</td><td>True</td>
	</tr>	
</table>

	<li> Give an example of combining statements

</ul>
</tt>

<p>Example:  counting snow pack in California, work through example.

<h4>Landsat Satellite Data</h4>

<p>
Landsat Satellite Program is a joint program of USGS and NASA that has provided continuous images of the earth since 1972. The data is publicly available through the USGS-EROS site and has been invaluable in mapping changes in the earth. Today, we will use data images from the USGS remote sensing gallery:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/gallery/">http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/gallery/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
The gallery consists usually of pairs of images demonstrating change over time.
Our challenges for today are:
<ul>
	<li> California drought: how much change has their been in the Sierra Nevada snowpack during the current drought?
	there are three images of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Count the amount of snow cover (pixels that are nearly white) in the image from 
	<a href="CaliforniaDrought_02232011_md.png">February 2011</a>. Then count the snow cover in 
	<a href="CaliforniaDrought_02122013_md.png">February 2013</a> and in 
	<a href="CaliforniaDrought_02232014_md.png">February 2014</a>. What is the percentage coverage (using 2011 as a baseline)?

<h3>Logical Circuits</h3>

<p>The logical expressions above are useful not only in designing decisions and selecting data in Python, but the same concept underlies much of the hardware of computers.  The <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and <tt>not</tt>.

Give a half adder as a circuit, rewrite as logical expressions.

<h3> More on the Command Line Interface:  Absolute Paths</h3>

<p><a href="lab4.html">Last lab</a>, we introduced relative paths for navigating the directories via the shell.  Relative paths (e.g. <tt>cd ../</tt>) used the current location when executing.  We can also use <i>absolute paths</i> that are independent of your location.  For example, 
<pre>
cd /usr/bin
pwd
ls
</pre>
will change your working directory to one of the machine's standard <tt>bin</tt> directories which is filled with programs, or binaries.  The next two commands show the path to the working directory and list its contents.  These binaries are in a central location to make it easier to find and use.

<p>Since it is nice to be able to return to your default, or home directory, there is a built-in short-cut for home (<tt>~</tt>).  Try
<pre>
cd ~
pwd
ls
</pre>
The first command will return you to your home directory, no matter where you started.

<p>Next lab, we will introduce options for obtaining more details about files in your directories.

<div>
<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a <a href="quizzes.html">quiz</a>.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.  To complete the quiz, log on to Blackboard (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for details on using Blackboard).

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
