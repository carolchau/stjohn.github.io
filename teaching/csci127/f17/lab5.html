<h3>Logical Expressions</h3>

<tt>
<ul>
	<li> Truth tables for ANDs and ORs.
	<li> Combining statements

</ul>
</tt>


<!--
<p> <b> Use in lab with if-statements</b>
Compute the complement of DNA strand- include images from wiki.  Instead of if-statements, use string methods to replace each letter.  Translate to lower case (to avoid translate items twice), then use upper case to make it look the same as input format.
-->

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you, and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
