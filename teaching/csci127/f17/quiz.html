<h2>Quiz Information<br>CSci 127: Introduction to Computer Science<br>
Hunter College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2017<br><br>
</h2>
</div>

<div>
At every recitation, there will be an in-class quiz on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory 
exercises.  
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.  
	<li> All quizzes must be taken during class time, and <b>there are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, we will drop up to two missed quizzes
	(if you take all quizzes, we will drop the lowest two scores).
	<li> The top 12 (out of 14 possible) quiz scores will count towards the quiz score in the final grade.  If you do better on the final examination than on the top 12 quizzes, we will replace up to 5 quizzes with your final exam grade.  
	<li> All computer-based quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell and C++ programming environment.
	<li> If you miss your assigned recitation, you may take a quiz during another section before the deadline, subject to availability and instructor's permission.
	<!--
	<li> The programming quizzes are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam and many programming job interviews).  For these, you may
	<b>not</b> use your notes, books, or computer. -->
		</ul>
</ul>
