<h2>Problem Set 6</h2>
<h3>CMP 338: Data Structures and Algorithms <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2011<br><br>
</h3>

<p>
This problem set covers stacks.  
See the class webpage for references.

<div>
This assignment focuses on using stacks for parsing and 
simple calculations.  The necessary files are available 
on Blackboard.


<ol>


<li><b>Adding Operators</b> (30 points)

<p>
Modify the postfix program (available on Blackboard) to 
allow the user to enter the additional operators:
<ul>
	<li> subtraction (-),
	<li> division (/),
	<li> increment (++),
	<li> decrement (--)
</ul>
<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>

<li><b>Analysis</b> (20 points)

<p>
What is the order of growth of the worst case time
needed to process an arithmetic expression?  Justify
your answer.
</p>

<p>
Submit your answer via Blackboard as a text or word
file.
</p>


<li><b>Shunting Algorithm: From Infix to Postfix</b> (50 points)

<p>Implement Dijkstra's Shunting Algorithm (see webpage
for algorithms) that 
converts infix notation to postfix.  Your program 
should take as input a string in infix notation,
use the Shunting Algorithm to convert the input
to postfix notation, and then use your program 
above to calculate the answer.  
</p>

<p>For example, if the user enters <tt>12 * (4 + 5) / 6</tt>,
you should convert it to <tt>12 4 5 + * 6 /</tt> and then 
apply the calculator code (from the first part of the homework)
to yield <tt>18</tt>.  See <a href="http://www.chris-j.co.uk/parsing.php">http://www.chris-j.co.uk/parsing.php</a>
for excellent examples.</p>

<p>Submit your answer as a .java file via Blackboard.</p>
