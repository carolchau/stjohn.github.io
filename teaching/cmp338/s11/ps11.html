<ol>
<li><b>Linear Search</b> (10 points)

<p>Set up a simple program that generates 100 random integers between 1 and 100,000
and stores them in an array.  Write a method that takes a integer as input and
returns the index if the number occurs in your array, -1 otherwise.</p>

<p>Write a simple driver program that demonstrates that your program works.</p>

<p>Submit the program as .java file to Blackboard.</p>


<li><b>Hash Table Using Chaining</b> (30 points)

<p>Modify your program above to also include a hash table using chaining.  The
hash table should be inplemented "by hand" (in constrast to the next section where
you implement it using the "built in" classes).  You should set your table size 
to 100 and populate with the same random integers that you place in your array.</p>

<p>Write a simple driver program that demonstrates that your program works.</p>

<p>Submit the program as .java file to Blackboard.</p>


<li><b>HashMap and HashTable</b> (20 points)

<p>Modify your program above to also include a hash table implemented with 
<tt>HashMap</tt> and <tt>HashTable</tt>.  You should populate these with the 
same random integers that you place in your array and hand-made hash table.</p>

<p>Write a simple driver program that demonstrates that your program works.</p>

<p>Submit the program as .java file to Blackboard.</p>


<li><b>Test Cases</b> (20 points)

<p>Run your program on the following:
<ul>
	<li> the universe is 1,...,10,000; the table/array size (m) is 100; the number of entries is 100; search for the number 1000
	<li> the universe is 1,...,10,000; the table/array size (m) is 1,000; the number of entries is 1000; search for the number 1000
	<li> the universe is 1,...,100,000; the table/array size (m) is 1,000; the number of entries is 500; search for the number 1000
	<li> the universe is 1,...,100,000; the table/array size (m) is 1,000; the number of entries is 100; search for the number 1000
	<li> the universe is 1,...,100,000; the table/array size (m) is 10,000; the number of entries is 1000; search for the number 1000 
</ul>

<p>
Run the test 10 times and make a table with your average search time for each of the four 
structures as well as the standard deviation. Submit your table via Blackboard. 
</p>
<p>
Submit your answers as an excel or text file via Blackboard.
</p>

<li><b>Analysis</b> (20 points)


<p>
Using your data above, answer the following questions:
<ul>

	<li> Which structure has the fastest search times?
	<li> Which structure was easiest to implement?
	<li> In the future, which would you choose to implement a map class where you store
		values by their key?
	<li> What affects running time more, table size or load factor (alpha = m/n)?	
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Submit your answers as a text file via Blackboard.
