<h2>Problem Set 4</h2>

<li><b>Linked Lists</b> (30 points)

<p>
Using the singly-linked list done "by hand" from 
<a href="http://leepoint.net/notes-java/data/collections/lists/simple-linked-list.html">Java Notes</a>
as your base,
add the following methods:
<ul>
	<li> insert a new word at the end of the list
	<li> print out the first word from the list and remove it from the list
	<li> add a new word at index <tt>i</tt>
</ul>
<p>
Your program should demonstrate that these methods work by printing out the list after each 
of these operations have been performed.

<p>To analyze the running time of each method, include the following:
<ul>
	<li> code to time each method, in milliseconds, in the <tt>main()</tt> method (see previous
		problem sets for examples).
	<li> to slow down the methods (so we don't have to use such huge data sets for testing), add
		to each method, <tt>Thread.sleep(1)</tt> for every time you look at an element of the linked
		list.  This call will cause the program to wait for 1 millisecond before continuing.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Submit your answer as a <tt>.java</tt> file via Blackboard.</p>

<li><b>Test Cases</b> (20 points)

<p>
Calculate how long the following situations take:
<ul>
	<li> a list of 10 Strings, adding a new word at index 2
	<li> a list of 10 Strings, adding a new word at index 5	
	<li> a list of 100 Strings, adding a new word at index 2
	<li> a list of 100 Strings, adding a new word at index 50	
	<li> a list of 1000 Strings, adding a new word at index 2
	<li> a list of 1000 Strings, adding a new word at index 500
</ul>

<p>
Run each test 10 times and make a table with your average as well
as the standard deviation for each algorithm.  Submit your table 
via Blackboard.</p>

<li><b>Analysis</b> (20 points)

<p>
Using the table you created, answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Did the size of the list affect the running time for 
	the first two methods? Why or why not?
	<li> What affected the running time of the third method?  If
	size of the list is fixed, is the running time constant for
	this method?  If the index is fixed, is the running time constant
	for this method?
</ul>
<p>Submit your answer via Blackboard.</p>



<li><b>Order of Growth</b> (30 points)

<p>For <b>each of the three methods,</b> analyze their order of
growth.  That is, calculate a tight upper bound on their growth,
written in "big-Oh" notation.  Explain and justify your answer.
<p>Submit your answer via Blackboard.</p>
