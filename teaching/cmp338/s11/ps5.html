<h2>Problem Set 5</h2>
<h3>CMP 338: Data Structures and Algorithms <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2011<br><br>
</h3>

<p>
This problem set covers queues.  
See the class webpage for references.  

</p>

<div>
This assignment focuses on a simulation of a grocery store, 
using queues.  The initial simulation uses a queue to store
customers (with random arrival time and random number of 
items purchased).  The files are available on Blackboard.


<ol>


<li><b>Adding Payment Types</b> (10 points)

<p>
The initial simulation allows customers to only pay cash.
Alter the customer generation to allow the user to pay by
cash, check, credit or debit.
</p>

<p>
Payment type helps determine the transaction time of each
customer.  Each item in their cart takes 1/4 of minute to 
process.  If they pay cash, it takes an additional 2 
minutes to complete the transaction.  Add in the following
times for the different payment types:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>CASH: 2 minutes
	<li>CHECK: 3 minutes
	<li>CREDIT: 1 minute
	<li>DEBIT: 1 minute
</ul>

<p>
Submit to Blackboard, both the <tt>Customer</tt> java file
as well as the driver file that demonstrates these changes.

<li><b>Testing Multiple Payment Types</b> (10 points)

<p>Compare your program above to the original program, on 
the following cases:
<ul>
	<li> 50 customers, at most 10 minutes apart and at most 25 items
	<li> 500 customers, at most 10 minutes apart and at most 25 items	
	<li> 50 customers, at most 5 minutes apart and at most 25 items
	<li> 500 customers, at most 5 minutes apart and at most 25 items
</ul>

<p>
Run each test 10 times and make a table with your average as well
as the standard deviation for each algorithm.  Submit your table 
via Blackboard.</p>

<li><b>Analysis</b> (10 points)

<p>
Using the table you created, answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Did allowing different payment types affect the <b>wait
	time</b> of the customers when customers arrived between 1 and
	10 minutes apart? Why or why not?
	<li> Did allowing different payment types affect the <b>wait
	time</b> of the customers when customers arrived between 1 and
	5 minutes apart? Why or why not?	
	<li> What affect does the distribution of arrival times have
	on wait times?
</ul>
<p>Submit your answer via Blackboard.</p>

<li><b>Multiple Servers</b> (50 points)

<p>
The next step is to modify the current simulation to have more 
than one check out line.  Modify your program to have:
<ul>
	<li><b>five</b> <tt>lines</tt> that customers can enter, representing
	five different check out lines.
	<li>when a new customer enters the store (that is, the
	<tt>currentTime</tt> equals their <tt>arrivalTime</tt>), they
	choose the line with the shortest time (calculate for each 
	line how much time the customers will take, and then the new
	person joins the one with the least time).
</ul>

<p>Since you will be repeatedly calculating the time for each line, 
write a method that takes a line as input and calculates the time 
it will take to process those customers.

<p>
Submit to Blackboard your main program (and the <tt>Customer</tt> java 
file if you changed that) that demonstrates these changes.



<li><b>Testing Multiple Servers</b> (10 points)

<p>Compare your program above (with 5 servers) to the original program
(with 1 server), on the following cases:
<ul>
	<li> 50 customers, at most 10 minutes apart and at most 25 items
	<li> 500 customers, at most 10 minutes apart and at most 25 items	
	<li> 50 customers, at most 5 minutes apart and at most 25 items
	<li> 500 customers, at most 5 minutes apart and at most 25 items
</ul>

<p>
Run each test 10 times and make a table with your average as well
as the standard deviation for each algorithm.  Submit your table 
via Blackboard.</p>


<li><b>Analysis</b> (10 points)

<p>
Using the table you created, answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> For which of the four situations tested, did the extra
	servers make the most difference?
	<li> Since your program had 5 times as many check-out lines
	(aka servers), your program should have lower wait times 
	for the customers.  Were they 5 times better?  Explain your
	answer.
</ul>
<p>Submit your answer via Blackboard.</p>
