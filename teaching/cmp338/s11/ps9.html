<div>
In this assignment, you will find paths between points and 
calculate the size of components in a random graph.  
The necessary files are available 
on Blackboard.


<ol>


<li><b>Isolated Vertices, Paths, and Components</b> (60 points)

<p>
The file <tt>RandomGraphs.java</tt> (available on Blackboard) uses an
adjacency matrix to represent (Erdos-Renyi) random graphs.  

<p>Write the following methods for the random graphs:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>int isolatedVertices()</tt> returns the number of isolated
		vertices in the graph, i.e. those nodes that have no neighbors
	<li> <tt>boolean isPath(int source, int target)</tt> returns true if
		there is path between <tt>source</tt> and <tt>target</tt>.  Otherwise,
		returns false.
	<li> <tt>boolean connected()</tt> returns true if the graph is connected
		(i.e. there's a path between every two nodes) and false otherwise.
	<li> <tt>int numComponents()</tt> returns the number of connected 
		components in the graph.  This number is bounded between 1 (the
		completely connected graph) and <tt>SIZE</tt> of the graph (a
		graph consisting of all isolated vertices).
</ul>
<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>


<li><b>Test Cases</b> (20 points)

<p>For graphs with 20 vertices and 
edge probability = <tt>1/10, 1/9, 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1/1</tt>, 
report the following:
<ul>
	<li> the fraction of isolated vertices (i.e. the number of isolated vertices
		divided by the total number of vertices, 20)
	<li> the number of components in the graph
	<li> if there is a path from node <tt>1</tt> to <tt>2</tt>
	<li> if the graph is connected
	<li> the number of components in the graph
</ul>

<p>
Run the test 10 times and make a table with your average fraction of isolated vertices
and average number of comoponents as well as the standard deviation.  For the last
three, report the fraction of time the condition held (i.e. 9/10 of graphs were connected).

<p>
 Submit your table via Blackboard.
</p>


<li><b>Analysis</b> (20 points)

<p>
Using your data above, answer the following questions:
<ul>

	<li> How does the fraction of isolated vertices change as the edge probability increases?
	<li> How does the number of components as the edge probability increases?	
	<li> How does connectivity of the graph change as the edge probability increases?	
	<li> Are the change in connectivity and number of isolated vertices related?  Why or why not?	
	<li> Are the change in connectivity and existence of a path related?  Why or why not?
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Submit your answers as a text file via Blackboard.
