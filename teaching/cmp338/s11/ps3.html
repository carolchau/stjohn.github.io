<h2>Problem Set 3</h2>
<h3>CMP 338: Data Structures and Algorithms <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2011<br><br>
</h3>

<p>
This problem set covers two new sorts covering in class: 
quicksort and radix sort.  See the class webpage for references.

<ol>

<li><b>QuickSort</b> (30 points)

<p>Using the <tt>SortingStrings.java</tt> as your driver program, implement 
the in-place <tt>QuickSort</tt> algorithm (ie the one at the 
end of the "Complex version" section on the wikipedia page).  

<p>Instead of an array of integers, have your quicksorts sort an
<tt>array of Strings</tt> (that is, <tt>String[] A</tt>).  Note
that to compare strings in Java, you should use <tt>string1.compareTo(string2)</tt>
where <tt>string1</tt> and <tt>string2</tt> are the names of 
your string variables.

<p>Submit the java file containing the quicksort
and a <tt>main</tt> that calls it to sort a
list.

<li><b>RadixSort</b> (30 points)

<p>Implement a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort">radix sort</a>
to sort arrays of strings of length 6.  Use the <tt>SortingString.java</tt>
file as your driver.  Note that in that file, there is an implementation 
of InsertionSort that can be used as the underlying stable sort for your
radix sort.

<p>Submit the java file containing the radix sort
and a <tt>main</tt> that calls it to sort a list.  Note that you can include 
both sorts in the same file.

<li><b>Test Cases</b> (20 points)

<p>
For <b>both sorting algorithms,</b> 
calculate how long each algorithm takes to sort the 
following lists:
<ul>
	<li> a list of 100 random 6-character words
	<li> a list of 200 random 6-character words
	<li> a list of 300 random 6-character words
	<li> a list of 400 random 6-character words
	<li> a list of 500 random 6-character words
</ul>

<p>
Run each test 10 times and make a table with your average as well
as the standard deviation for each algorithm.  Submit your table 
via Blackboard.</p>

<li><b>Analysis</b> (20 points)

<p>
Using the table you created, answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> From your data, which sort did the best overall?  Why?
	<li> We know that asymptotic running time of radix sort is O(n)
		while the asymptotic running time of the quick sort is O(n lg n).
		Did your data support this?  Why or why not?
</ul>
<p>Submit your answer via Blackboard.</p>
