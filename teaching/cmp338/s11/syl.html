<h2>CMP 338: Data Structures and Algorithms I<br>
Spring 2011</h2>


<p><b>Catalog Description</b>:  4 hours, 4 credits.  
Abstract characterizations as well as the design and implementation of 
data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, binary search trees, 
heaps, and graphs along with algorithms that make use of such structures 
including algorithms for sorting, searching, and memory management, will be studied.  
Algorithms will be analyzed for their asymptotic behavior in terms of time complexity 
and space requirements will be considered as well.  Implementation issues will be 
considered and students will write programs that embody these data structures and 
algorithms.<br>
Prerequisites: CMP 326 and CMP 232 
</b>

<p><b>Instructor:</b> Dr. Katherine St. John, stjohn AT lehman.cuny.edu<br>
<b>Office Hours:</b> <a href="../../officeHours.html">listed here</a><br>
<b>Class meetings:</b> Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 to 10:40 in Gillet 333.</p>


<h2>Grading Policy</h2>

<p>
<b>Expectations:</b> Students are expected to learn both the material covered in 
class and from the textbook and any other assigned reading.  Students must write 
readable and complete programs that execute correctly.  Completing homework is part 
of the learning experience.  Students should review material from prior courses as 
needed using old notes and textbooks.</p>

<p>
<b>Homework:</b> In addition to explicitly assigned problems, students should implement 
each data structure and algorithm that is covered in class.  Style and comments are
a necessary component of programs.  Complete sentences, correct spelling and 
grammar are expected for written exercises.  Homework will be 
submitted via the campus Blackboard system and is <b>due by midnight</b> of the
assigned date.</p>

<p>Note that no late homework is accepted.  However, there is a bonus for turning
in homework early-- up to 12 points for 2 days early (prorated at .25 points for
every hour early).
</p>

<p>
<b>Exams:</b> There will be two midterm exams and a final exam.  The exams will be:
<ul>
	<li> Tuesday, 8 March, 9-10:40
	<li> Tuesday, 5 April, 9-10:40
	<li> Thursday, 26 May, 8:30-10:30
</ul>
Since the final exam is comprehensive, if you do better on the final exam than
the midterm exams, the final grade can replace those grades.  There are no make-up exams.
</p>

<p>
<b>Grades:</b> The precise grading policy for your section will be determined by your instructor.
<ul>
	<li> 40% for Homework 
	<li> 15% for First Midterm Exam
	<li> 15% for Second Midterm Exam 
	<li> 30% for Final Exam
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h2>

<p>
<b>Textbook:</b>  There is no required textbook for the course.  Suggested books
include <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest (about $70
from Amazon.com) and <em>Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with Java: Walls and Mirrors</em> 
by Frank M. Carrano and Janet J. Prichard (about $115 on Amazon.com).</p>

<p>
<b>Technology:</b> Students will need to have access to personal computers with Java 
IDE software installed.  Such computers are available for student use on campus.  
For students with computers at home, Java IDE Software is available free of charge 
on the internet.  See, for example, <a href="http://eclipse.org">eclipse.org</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Accommodating Disabilities:</b> Lehman College is committed to providing access to 
all programs and curricula to all students.  Students with disabilities who may need 
classroom accommodations are encouraged to register with the Office of Student 
Disability Services.  For more information, please contact the Office of Student 
Disabilities, Shuster Hall, Room 238, phone number (718) 960-8441.

Course Objectives
</h2>
      
<p>      
At the end of the course students should:
</p>

<ol>
	<li> Analyze and use lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hashes.
	<li> Be able to describe formal analysis measures as well as use them 
	in the analysis of new data structures and algorithms.
	<li> Describe and use abstraction for problem solving.
	<li> Apply algorithm design techniques to solve programming challenges
	efficiently.
