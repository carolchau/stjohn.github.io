<h2>Problem Set 8</h2>
<h3>CMP 338: Data Structures and Algorithms <br>

</h3>

<p>
This problem set covers priority queues and heaps.

<div>
In this assignment, you will implement a priority queue for student enrollment at Lehman.  
<!--The necessary files are available 
on Blackboard.-->


<ol>


<li><b>Student Class</b> (20 points)

<p>
At Lehman College, students are assigned registration appointments based
on several factors.  Make a <tt>Student</tt> class that holds the following
information:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <tt>name</tt>: the name of the student
	<li> <tt>numCredits</tt>: the number of credits the student has earned (must
			be a positive integer)
	<li> <tt>priority</tt>: the student's priority for registration (must be a 
			positive integer)
	<li> <tt>athlete</tt>: true if the student is on a collge athletics team, false otherwise
	<li> <tt>honors</tt>: true if the student is a member of the honors college, false otherwise
</ul>

<p>
You should also have the following methods:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> <tt>setPriority()</tt>:  Sets the <tt>priority</tt> based on the following:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>numCredits <= 15</tt> (lower freshman), priority is set to 1
			<li> <tt>15 < numCredits <= 30</tt> (upper freshman), priority is set to 2
			<li> <tt>30 < numCredits <= 45</tt> (lower sophomore), priority is set to 3
			<li> <tt>45 < numCredits <= 60</tt> (upper sophomore), priority is set to 4
			<li> <tt>60 < numCredits <= 75</tt> (lower junior), priority is set to 5
			<li> <tt>75 < numCredits <= 90</tt> (upper junior), priority is set to 6
			<li> <tt>90 < numCredits <= 105</tt> (lower senior), priority is set to 7
			<li> <tt>105 < numCredits <= 120</tt> (upper senior), priority is set to 8
			<li> <tt>120 < numCredits</tt>, priority is set to 9
		</ul>
		If the student is an athelete or an honors student, the student receives an 
		extra 10 points to their priority ranking.  For example, a starting freshman
		who is an athlete, will have <tt>priority = 1 + 10 = 11</tt>.
	<li> <tt>toString()</tt>: returns a string with instance variables.  For example, 
		<tt>"Student12, 78 credits, athlete, not honors; priority: 16"</tt>
</ul>
<p>
Submit your class as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>


<li><b>Enrollment Priority System</b> (20 points)

<p> 
Write a program to simulate the enrollment priority system.  Your program 
should generate 1000 students at random, and store the students in a priority
queue (<em>implemented as an array based heap</em>), using the 
<tt>priority</tt> variable as the key.  When generating the students, you should:
<ul>
	<li> assign the names "Student1", "Student2", etc, so they can be identified
		later on,
	<li> randomly generate the number of credits between 0 and 130,
	<li> randomly assign students to the honor college with a probability of 1%
		(i.e. we expect 1 out of every 100 students will be a member of the honor college)
	<li> randomly assign student atheletes with a probability of 5%
		(i.e. we expect 1 out of every 20 students will be an athelete)

</ul>
<p>
Use the heapsort algorithm that will print out students, ordered
by <tt>priority</tt>.

<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>


<li><b>Simulation</b> (20 points)

<p> 
The mathematics department has decided to offer a new course called, "Pi: The 
Intersection of Mathematics and Cooking" that fulfils the mathematics requirement,
science requirement, writing requirement, counts as an LEH 300 course, and 
feeds the student at every class.  It is very popular, but there are only 20
seats available in the class.  </p>

<p>
Extend your simulation program above.  After generating the students and 
populating the priority queue, remove students from the priority queue 
until the course fills.  You may assume that 10% of the students will sign up 
for the course.  Continue removing students from the queue until the course
fills.  Report the priority level and number of credits of the last student who 
enrolls for the course.  For example, if <tt>student12</tt> from the 
example above is the 20th student to enroll, your program 
should report:
<pre>
Class full.  Last student to enroll had priority 16 and 78 credits.
</pre>

<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>


<li><b>Test Cases</b> (20 points)

<p>Run the following tests of your program
<ul>

   	<li> the original settings:  1% honors, 5% atheletes, 10% demand for Pi course.
	<li> less atheletes: 1% honors, 2% atheletes, 10% demand for Pi course.
	<li> more atheletes: 1% honors, 10% atheletes, 10% demand for Pi course.	
	<li> less demand: 1% honors, 2% atheletes, 5% demand for Pi course.
	<li> more deman: 1% honors, 2% atheletes, 20% demand for Pi course.		

</ul>
<p>
Run the test 10 times and make a table with the average of the credits of the last student
to be enrolled (and fraction with honors/athlete status) as well as the standard deviation 
for each algorithm. Submit your table via Blackboard.


<li><b>Analysis</b> (20 points)

<p>
Using your data above, answer the following questions:
<ul>

	<li> Does the number of athletes in the simulation affect whether a senior can get into
	the Pi class?
	<li> Does the number of athletes in the simulation affect whether a sophomore can get into
	the Pi class?
	<li> Does the demand for the Pi course in the simulation affect whether a senior can get into
	the Pi class?
<li> Does the demand for the Pi course in the simulation affect whether a sophomore can get into
	the Pi class?	

</ul>
</p>
