<h2>Problem Set 7</h2>

<p>
This problem set covers binary search trees.  
See the class webpage for references.

<div>
In this assignment, you will implement useful methods for binary 
search trees, as well as analyze performance.  The necessary files are available 
on Blackboard.


<ol>


<li><b>Rotating Binary Search Trees</b> (60 points)

<p>
Using the base program discussed in class (available on Blackboard), 
add the following methods:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>height(N):</tt> returns the height of the tree rooted at <tt>N</tt>
	<li> <tt>rotateLeft(N):</tt> rotate the tree to the left at node <tt>N</tt>, 
		if the right child of <tt>N</tt> is not null.
	<li> <tt>rotateRight(N):</tt> rotate the tree to the right at node <tt>N</tt>, 
		if the left child of <tt>N</tt> is not null.
</ul>
<p>
For a good description of rotating binary trees, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_rotation">Wiki
page</a>.

<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>

<li><b>Test Cases</b> (20 points)

<p>Report the following:
<ul>

   	<li> the height of a tree created by inserting 127 randomly generated numbers 
    	(ranging from 1 to 500) are inserted into a binary	search tree.
	<li> the height of the initial tree after 1 left rotations at the root (if possible).
	<li> the height of the initial tree after 1 right rotations at the root (if possible).    			
	<li> the height of the same tree after 3 left rotations at the root (if possible).
	<li> the height of the initial tree after 3 right rotations at the root (if possible).

</ul>
<p>
Run the test 10 times and make a table with your average heights as well as the standard deviation 
for each algorithm. Submit your table via Blackboard.

<li><b>Analysis</b> (20 points)

<p>
Using your data above, answer the following questions:
<ul>

	<li> Do single rotations, on average, shorten the height of the tree?  Why or why not?
	<li> Do three rotations in a row, on average, shorten the height of the tree?  Why or why not?
	<li> The shortest tree possible with 127 keys has height 6, while the tallest possible tree
		has height 126.  How close were your trees to the best (ie shortest) height?
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Submit your answer via Blackboard as a text or word
file.
