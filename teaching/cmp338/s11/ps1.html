<li><b>Implement Binary Search</b> (15 points)

<p>In lecture, we reviewed two searching algorithms:  <tt>linear search</tt>
and <tt>binary search</tt>.  Modify the existing code for linear sort 
(available from Blackboard) to also include binary search. 
The pseudocode for binary search is available from:</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm</a>
</p>

<p>
You may implement either the recursive or iterative version of binary sort.
</p>


<p>
Submit your sorting methods and a driver that demonstrates that they
work to the Blackboard.
</p>

<li><b>Test Cases</b> (20 points)

<p>
For <b>both search algorithms</b>, time how long each algorithm takes to find the 
following number from a sorted list of 10,000,000 numbers:
<ul>
	<li> 500
	<li> 1,000,000
	<li> 5,000,000
	<li> 10,000,000
	<li> 15,000,001
	<li> 20,000,000
</ul>
Run each test 10 times and make a table with the running 
time for each run, as well as the average and
the standard deviation for each algorithm.  Submit your table 
via Blackboard.</p>

<li><b>Analysis</b> (15 points)

<p>
Using the table you created, answer the following questions
(in complete sentences):
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Was linear search ever faster than binary search?
	When?
	<li> If both searches report the time as 0 milliseconds
	for an instance, do they take the same amount of time?
	Why or why not?
	<li> Which was the faster search overall?  	
</ul>
<p>Submit your answer via Blackboard.</p>
