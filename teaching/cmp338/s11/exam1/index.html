<h3>Exam Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The exam is closed book and closed notes. </li>
  <li> When taking the exam, you may have with you
    <ul>
      <li> a single 8 1/2" x 11" (or A4) piece of paper filled with notes,
programs, etc. </li>
      <li> pens or pencils </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> You may not use a computer or calculator. </li>
  <li> All books and bags must be left at the front of the classroom
during this exam. This is to keep the aisles clear, so that I can
easily reach people to answer questions. </li>
  <li> You must be enrolled in the course to take the exam. When you
enter the classroom, you will be given an exam. You may write your name
on the exam, but <font color="red">do not open it</font> until
instructed to do so. This is so everyone has the same amount of time to
complete the exam. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>How to Prepare</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Do the assigned reading. </li>
  <li> Make sure you do all the problem sets that have been
assigned. The problems (or parts of them) make excellent exam
questions. </li>
  <li> Work through the sample and past exams. These (or variations of them)
often appear on exams. </li>
</ul>
