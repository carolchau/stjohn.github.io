<li><b>Distance Between Two Cities</b> (10 points)

<p>Write a program that asks a user for the latitude and
longitude values for two cities and prints out their distance
in miles.  

<p>
Note that coordinates for cities are often given in terms of degrees and 
minutes (fractions of degrees).  To convert these coordinates into a 
single real number for the latitude and longitude, you can use the simple
formula of <tt>lat1 = originalLat + originalMin/60.0</tt>.  For example,
the latitude and longitude for New York City is:
<pre>
	40 degrees 47 minutes (north)
	73 degrees 58 minutes (west)
</pre>
So, <tt>lat1 = 40 + 47/60.0</tt> and <tt>lng1 = 73 + 58/60.0</tt>.  Since
all the cities we are comparing will be north of the equator and west of 
the dividing line, we can ignore signs in our calculations.


<p>The following method takes latitude and
longitude values for two cities and returns out their distance
in miles.  (This method implements the <a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html">Haversine formula</a>.)

<pre>
public static double distFrom(double lat1, double lng1, double lat2, double lng2) {
  double earthRadius = 3958.75;
  double dLat = Math.toRadians(lat2-lat1);
  double dLng = Math.toRadians(lng2-lng1);
  double a = Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
             Math.cos(Math.toRadians(lat1)) * Math.cos(Math.toRadians(lat2)) *
             Math.sin(dLng/2) * Math.sin(dLng/2);
  double c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
  double dist = earthRadius * c;
  
  return dist;
}
</pre>

<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>

<li><b>Distance Matrix for Cities</b> (20 points)

<p>Extend your program above to calculate a distance matrix for 
a list of cities.  Your program should accept input of the form:
<pre>
Albany, N.Y.	42	40	73	45
Albuquerque, N.M.	35	05	106	39
Amarillo, Tex.	35	11	101	50
Anchorage, Alaska	61	13	149	54
.
.
.
</pre>
where the data is tab-separated and the columns represent city
name, latitude degrees, latitude minutes, longitude degrees, longitude 
minutes.
(data from <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001796.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001796.html</a>)

<p>Your program should calculate the distances between every 
city pair (best to store in a 2-dimensional array for use in the
next part of the assignment) and print out these values.

<li><b>Kruskal's Algorithm</b> (20 points)

<p>
Extend your program to report the weight of the minimum spanning tree for 
a set of cities, using Kruskal's Algorithm (see class page for links to
pseudocode).

<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>

<li><b>Prim's Algorithm</b> (20 points)

<p>
Extend your program to report the weight of the minimum spanning tree for 
a set of cities, using Prim's Algorithm (see class page for links to
pseudocode).

<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>

<li><b>Test Cases</b> (20 points)

<p>
Run your implementation of Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm on 
the following test cases:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="cities_A.csv">US Cities starting with 'A'</a> (6 cities)<br>
	(from <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001796.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001796.html</a>)
	<li> <a href="cities_US_Canada.csv">Selected US and Canadian Cities</a>
		(from <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001796.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001796.html</a>) (129 cities)<br>
	<li> <a href="Airport_Codes_Truncated.csv">1000 Airport Codes of US Airports</a> (1000 of the 13,417 airports)<br>
		(from <a href ="http://opendata.socrata.com/dataset/Airport-Codes-mapped-to-Latitude-Longitude-in-the-/rxrh-4cxm">http://opendata.socrata.com/dataset/Airport-Codes-mapped-to-Latitude-Longitude-in-the-/rxrh-4cxm</a>)
</ul>
<p>For each test case and each algorithm, report the running time and weight 
of the minimum spanning tree found.

<p>Note that for the airport data, the latitude and longitude already include
the minutes as a decimal, so, that conversion above is not needed.


<p>
Submit your program as a .java file via Blackboard.
</p>



<li><b>Analysis</b> (10 points)

<p>
Using your data above, answer the following questions:
<ul>

	<li> Which algorithm computes lower weights for their minimum spanning trees?
	<li> Which does better in running time?	
	<li> Which algorithm would you choose to implement in the future for similar data?	Why?
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Submit your answers as a text file via Blackboard.
