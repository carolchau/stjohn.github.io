<b>Group work (from last lecture):</b>
<hr>
An employee is paid at the rate of $16.78 per hour for
regular hours worked in a week.  Any hours over that are
paid at the overtime rate of one and one half times that.
From the worker's gross pay 6 percent is withheld for
social security tax, 14 percent is withheld for federal
income tax, 5 percent is withheld for state income tax, 
and $10 withheld for union dues.  If the work has 3 or more
dependents, then an additional $35 per week is withheld
to cover the extra cost of health insurance.  Write a
program that will read in the number of hours worked in
a week and the number of dependents as input, and will
then output the worker's gross pay, each withholding
amount, and the net take-home pay.

<br>

<hr>
<b>An algorithm for this problem:</b>
<hr>
<ol>
	<li> Ask user for number of hours worked and number 
	of dependents.
	<li> If the number of hours worked is less than 40,
		multiply the number of hours by $16.78 to
		get the gross pay.<br>
	Else, the gross pay is the sum of 40 times $16.78
		and the number of hours over 40 times 1.5
		times $16.78.
	<li> Print out the gross pay.
	<li> Use the variable net_pay to keep track of the
		amount after withholding.  To begin with,
		set net_pay equal to the gross pay.
	<li> Print out 6 percent of the gross pay for 
		social security tax.  Subtract this amount
		from net_pay.
	<li> Print out 14 percent of the gross pay for 
		federal income tax.  Subtract this amount
		from net_pay.
	<li> Print out 5 percent of the gross pay for 
		state income tax.  Subtract this amount
		from net_pay.
	<li> Print out $10 for union dues.
		Subtract this amount from net_pay.
	<li> If the user has 3 or more dependents, print 
		out $35 for health insurance and 
		subtract this amount from net_pay.
	<li> Print out net_pay, the user's take-home pay 
		after withholding.
