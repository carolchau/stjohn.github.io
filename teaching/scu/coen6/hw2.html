<h2>Homework 2</h1>
<h3>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br>
Introduction to Computing</h3>

<hr>
The homework is <b>due by noon on Thursday, 22 January</b> to Dr. St. John's
mailbox in the Engineering Center.  25%  of the score will be
deducted for each day late.  The starred problems include programming and 
should be submitted both
electronically and on paper. In the paper portion of the starred problems,
you should include output of several test runs that demonstrates what your
program does. The electronic portion should be sent to
coen006@scudc.scu.edu (with subjects "hw 2.4" and "hw 2.5", respectively).
<hr>

<ol>
	<li> What does the following program do:
<pre> #include &lt;iostream.h&gt
// Mystery program
main()
{
    char a, b, c;

    a = 'b';
    b = 'c';
    c = a;
    cout &lt&lt a &lt&lt b &lt&lt c &lt&lt 'c';
} </pre>
	
	<li> Rewrite the program again.cpp from lecture on
	<a href= "Jan7.html">7 January</a> to contain a
     while loop, instead of a do-while loop. (This problem does not need to be
     submitted electronically.)
     
	<li>
	<ol>
	<li type=a> Give an output statement that will produce the 
		following message on the screen:
<pre>The answer to the question of
Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42.  </pre>
	<li type=a> Write an <b>if-else</b> statement that outputs
		the word "High" if the value of the variable
		<b>score</b> is greater than 100 and "Low" if the 
		value of <b>score</b> is at most 100.  The variable
		<b>score</b> is of type <b>int</b>.
	</ol>

	<li>* Workers at particular company have won a 7.6 percent pay increase
     retroactive for six months. Write a program that takes an employee's
     previous annual salary as input, and outputs the amount of retroactive
     pay due the employee, the new annual salary, and the new monthly
     salary. Use a variable declaration with the modifier <b>const</b>
	 to express the pay increase. 
     
  	<li>* A metric ton is 35,273.92 ounces.  Write a program that will
	read the weight of a package of breakfast cereal in ounces and output
	the weight in metric tons as well as the number of boxes needed to
	yield one metric ton of cereal.  Your program should allow the user
	to repeat this calculation as often as the user wishes.
