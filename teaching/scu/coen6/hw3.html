<h2>Homework 3</h2>
<h3>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br> 
Introduction to Computing</h3>


<hr>
<b>Due by noon, Thursday, 29 January.</b><br>
The paper portion should
be placed in Dr. St. John's box in the Engineering Center.
25% of the score will be
deducted for each day late. The starred problems include programming and should be submitted both electronically and on paper. In the
paper portion of the starred problems, you should include output of 
several test runs that demonstrates what your program does. The
electronic portion should be sent to coen006@scudc.scu.edu
(with subjects "hw 3.4" and "hw 3.5", respectively).

<ol>
	<li> Determine the value of:
		<ol>
			<li> <pre>pow(2,3)</pre>
			<li> <pre>(pow(2,3) <= pow(3,2))</pre>
			<li> <pre>sqrt(pow(3,2))</pre>
			<li> <pre>('a' == 'b')</pre>
			<li> <pre>abs(3-5)</pre>
		</ol>
	<li> 
	<ol>
		<li type= a> What does the following program do:<br>
<pre> #include &lt;iostream.h&gt
// Mystery Program

char mystery(int first, int second);

main()
{
	cout << mystery(10,9) << "ow\n";
}

char mystery(int first, int second)
{
	if (first >= second)
		return 'W';
	else
		return 'H';
} </pre>

	<li type=a> Suppose you have two function definitions with the following
		prototypes:<br>
<pre>
	double the_answer(double data1, double data2);
	double the_answer(double time, int count);
</pre>
		Which function definition would be used in the following 
		function call and why would it be used? (x and y are of
		type <b>double</b>)<br>
<pre>
	x = the_answer(y, 6.0)
</pre>
	</ol>

	<li> Write a function prototype and function definition for a function
		that takes three arguments, all of type <b>int</b>, and
		returns the sum of its three arguments.


	<li> * The price of stock on the New York Stock Exchange is now
		given to the nearest sixteenth of a dollar; for example,
		29 7/16 or 19 1/2.  Write a program that computes the 
		value of the user's holding of one stock.  The program asks 
		for the number of shares of the stock owned, the whole
		dollar portion of the price and the fraction portion.
		The fraction portion is to be input as two <b>int</b>
		values, one for the numerator and one for the demoninator.
		The program then outputs the value of the user's holdings.
		Your program should allow the user to repeat this calculation
		as often as the user wishes.  Your program will include a
		function definition that has three <b>int</b> arguments
		consisting of the whole dollar portion of the price and the 
		two integers that make up the fraction part.  The function
		returns the price of one share of stock as a single number
		of type <b>double</b>.
	<li> * If a waterballoon is fired with an angle of elevation,
		<b>a</b> and an initial velocity, <b>v</b>,
		the distance travelled <b>d</b> is:<br>
<pre>
	d = (v*v*sin(2*a))/g
</pre>
		(we are assuming that air resistance is negligible and the
		only external force is due to gravity: <b>g = 9.8</b>).
		Write a program that computes the 
		distance the user's water balloon travels.  The program asks 
		for angle of elevation and the initial velocity of the 
		balloon.
		The program then outputs the distance travelled.  If the
		water balloon lands within 2 meters of the user, the program
		should also print out a message saying the user has gotten
		wet from the impact of the balloon.
		Your program should allow the user to repeat this calculation
		as often as the user wishes.
