<h2>Homework 5</h2>
<h2>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br> 
Introduction to Computing</h2>


<hr>
<b>Due by noon, Thursday, 12 February.</b><br>
The starred problems include programming and should be submitted
both electronically and on paper.  In the paper portion of the
starred problems, you should include output of several test runs
that demonstrates what your program does.
The electronic portion
should be sent to coen006@scudc.scu.edu (with subjects
"hw 5.4" and "hw 5.5", respectively).
The paper portion should
be placed in Dr. St. John's box in the Engineering Center.

<ol>
	<li> Consider the following code (and assume it is embedded
	in a complete and correct program and then run):
<pre>
char next;
int count = 0;
cout &lt&lt "Enter a line of input:\n";
cin.get(next);
while ( next != '\n' )
{
    if ( (count%2) == 0 )
        cout &lt&lt next;
    count++;
    cin.get(next);
}
</pre> 

	If the dialogue begins as follows, what will be the next line
	of output?
<pre>
Enter a line of output:
abcdef gh
</pre>

	<li> Write the definition for the void-function called
	<b>text_to_screen</b> which has one formal parameter called 
	<b>file_stream</b> that is of type <b>ifstream</b>.  The
	precondition and postcondition for the function are:

<pre>
// Precondition: The stream file_stream has been connected to a file
// with a call to the member function open.
// Postcondition: The contents of the file connected to file_stream
// have been copied to the screen character by character so that the
// screen output is the same as the contents of the text in the file.
// (This function does not close the file).
</pre>
	This problem can be done by hand and should not be turned in
	electronically. 

	<li> Write a C++ function that will read a line of text
	from the keyboard and echo the line in uppercase letters.
	<br>
	This problem can be done by hand and should not be turned in
	electronically. 
	 
	<li>* Write a program that adds line numbers to a file
	and stores the result in an output file.  For example,
	if your input file is:
<pre>
hello
helloo
hellooo
</pre>
	Your output file would be:
<pre>
1   hello
2   helloo
3   hellooo
</pre>
	Your program should ask the user for the name of the 
	input and output files.  It should also use the formatting
	functions to make the line number take at most 4 spaces 
	and always be flush to the left column.

	<li>* Write a program counts the number of characters (not
	including carriage returns), the number of words, and the
	number of lines in a file.  Ask the user to enter the name
	of the file and print your results to the screen.

	<p>
	You can check your work by
	using the UNIX command <b>wc</b> on your input file.  For
	example, if you type
	<pre>wc template.html</pre>
	at the "bash$" prompt, the response is:
	<pre>33     116     810 template.html</pre>
	where 33 is the number of lines, 116 is the number of words,
	and 810 is the number of characters in template.html.  Note
	that it is difficult to read this output without prior 
	knowledge of what the columns should be.  Your program should
	label the output for the user.

</ol>
<!--  Don't know arrays yet!
<ol>
	<li> Write a function definition that swaps the values of two 
	variables of type <b>double</b> with the following function 
	prototype:
<pre>
    void swap( double& first, double& second );
</pre>


	<li> What is the output of the following code (when embedded
	in a complete and correct program)?
<pre>
    char letters[3] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
    int index;

    for ( index = 0 ; index < 3 ; index++ )
         cout &lt&lt letters[index]  &lt&lt " " &lt&lt letters[2-index] 
              &lt&lt endl;
</pre>

	<li> What is the output of the following code (when embedded
	in a complete and correct program)?
<pre>
    double a[3] = {1.2, 3.4, 5.6};

    cout &lt&lt a[0] &lt&lt " " &lt&lt a[1] &lt&lt " " &lt&lt a[2]
         &lt&lt endl;
    a[1] = a[2];
    a[0] = a[1];
    cout &lt&lt a[0] &lt&lt " " &lt&lt a[1] &lt&lt " " &lt&lt a[2]
         &lt&lt endl;
</pre>


	<li>* Write a program that asks the user to enter 10 decimal
		numbers and stores them in an array.  The program 
		then prints out the numbers read in, separated by
		spaces.  If the first number is greater than the 
		second number, the two numbers' values are 
		swapped in the array using the <b>swap</b> function
		for Problem 1.  Print out the array.  
		If the second number is then greater than the 
		third number, the two numbers' values are 
		swapped in the array using the <b>swap</b> function.
		Then print out the array.  You should continue this
		swapping if the number is greater than the the
		next one until you reach the end of the array.
		Print out the result of each swap.

		For example, if the user enters:
<pre>
    3.2 0.4 6.0 5.0 1.1 8.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 2.2
</pre>
		The output of the program would be:
<pre>
The numbers entered:
    3.2 0.4 6.0 5.0 1.1 8.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 2.2
Checking item 1 and 2:
    0.4 3.2 6.0 5.0 1.1 8.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 2.2
Checking item 2 and 3:
    0.4 3.2 6.0 5.0 1.1 8.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 2.2
Checking item 3 and 4:
    0.4 3.2 5.0 6.0 1.1 8.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 2.2
Checking item 4 and 5:
    0.4 3.2 5.0 1.1 6.0 8.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 2.2
Checking item 5 and 6:
    0.4 3.2 5.0 1.1 6.0 8.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 2.2
Checking item 6 and 7:
    0.4 3.2 5.0 1.1 6.0 1.5 8.0 2.2 5.2 2.2
Checking item 7 and 8:
    0.4 3.2 5.0 1.1 6.0 1.5 2.2 8.0 5.2 2.2
Checking item 8 and 9:
    0.4 3.2 5.0 1.1 6.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 8.0 2.2
Checking item 9 and 10:
    0.4 3.2 5.0 1.1 6.0 1.5 2.2 5.2 2.2 8.0
</pre>

	<li>* Write a program that allows the user to enter up to 
		25 non-negative scores, and prints out the average
		of the scores and the standard deviation.  The standard
		deviation is defined to be the square root of the 
		average of the values 
<pre>
( s1 - a )*( s1 - a ), ( s2 - a )*( s2 - a ), ... ,( sLast-a )*( sLast - a)
</pre>
		where s1,...,sLast are the score the user entered and
		a is the average.  

		For example, if the user entered the
		four numbers: 3 5 7 9.  The average would be (3+5+7+9)/4.0,
		which equals 6.  The standard deviation is 
<pre>
sqrt[(3 - 6)*(3 - 6) + (5 - 6)*(5 - 6) + (7 - 6)*(7 - 6) + (9 - 6)*(9 - 6)/4]
        = sqrt[[9 + 1 + 1 + 9)/4]
        = sqrt(20/4)
	= sqrt(5)
</pre>

		Your program should use an array to store the scores,
		include functions that compute the 
		average, compute the standard deviation, and handle
		getting the information, and printing the results. 
		Also, include a loop that lets the user repeat this computation
		for new input values until the user says he or she wants
		to end the program.
