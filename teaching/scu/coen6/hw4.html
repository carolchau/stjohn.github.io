<h2>Homework 4</h2>
<h2>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br> 
Introduction to Computing</h2>


<hr>
<b>Due by noon, Thursday, 5 February.</b><br>
The starred problems include programming and should be submitted
both electronically and on paper.  In the paper portion of the
starred problems, you should include output of several test runs
that demonstrates what your program does.
The electronic portion
should be sent to coen006@scudc.scu.edu (with subjects
"hw 4.4" and "hw 4.5", respectively).
The paper portion should
be placed in Dr. St. John's box in the Engineering Center.

<!--
use AM/PM in place of the compute_coin program
add line numbers?
program that indents for style?
-->

<ol>
	<li>
		<ol>	
			<li type=a> Write a <b>void</b> function definition 
				that takes 3 integers as
				input and outputs the product of these 3 
				numbers to the screen.

			<li type =a> Write a <b>void</b> function 
				definition for a fucntion called
				<b>zero_both</b> that takes two arguments, 
				both of which are type of <b>double</b>, and 
				sets the values of both variables to 0.

		</ol>

	<li> What is the output of the following program?
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt
void figure_me_out(int& x, int y, int& z);
int main()
{
    int a,b,c;

    a = 10;
    b = 20;
    c = 30;

    figure_me_out(a, b, c);
    cout &lt&lt a &lt&lt " " &lt&lt b &lt&lt " " &lt&lt c;

    return 0;
}

void figure_me_out(int& x, int y, int& z)
{
    cout &lt&lt x &lt&lt " " &lt&lt y &lt&lt " " &lt&lt z &lt&lt endl;
    x = 1;
    y = 2;
    z = 3;
    cout &lt&lt x &lt&lt " " &lt&lt y &lt&lt " " &lt&lt z &lt&lt endl;
}
</pre>
	<li> Which are illegal statements in C++?  Give reasons for any
		statement which is not legal:	
		<ol>
			<li type = a> <pre> cout.setf(ios::showpoint); </pre>
			<li type = a> <pre> cin &gt&gt answer;</pre>
			<li type = a> <pre> cin &lt&lt x &lt&lt y;</pre>
			<li type = a> <pre> if ( x == pow(2,10)/2 ) 
	cout &lt&lt "OK";</pre>
			<li type = a> <pre> ifstream infile;
  infile.open(); </pre>
			<li type = a> <pre> print_output(x;y;z);</pre>
			<li type = a> <pre> cout &lt&lt abs(4-sqrt(x));</pre>
			<li type = a> <pre> 2++;</pre>
		</ol>	


	<li>*  Write a program that converts from twenty-four hour
		notation to twelve-hour notation.  For example, it should
		convert 14:25 to 2:25 PM.  The input is given as two
		integers.  There should be at least three functions,
		one for input, one to do the conversion, and one for
		output.  Record the AM/PM information as a value of type
		<b>char</b>, 'A' for AM and 'P' for PM.  Thus the
		function for doing the conversions will have a 
		call-by-reference formal parameter of type <b>char</b>
		to record whether it is AM or PM.  (The function will
		have other parameters as well.)  Include a loop that 
		will lets the user repeat this computation for new
		input values again and again until the user says he
		or she wants to end the program. 

	<li>* Write a program that will read in 20 numbers from the
		file "numbers.in" and will output the average and 
		standard deviation of those numbers.  (Note that this
		is very similar to Lab 3, except we are reading the
		numbers from a file, not the keyboard).  
		Do not use a variable for each of the twenty numbers.
		Instead, sum the numbers as you read them in from the
		file, calculate the average, close the file, and
		reopen the file to calculate the standard deviation.
