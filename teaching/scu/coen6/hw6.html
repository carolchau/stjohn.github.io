<h2>Homework 6</h2>
<h2>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br> 
Introduction to Computing</h2>


<hr>
<b>Due by noon, Thursday, 19 February.</b><br>
The starred problems include programming and should be submitted
both electronically and on paper.  In the paper portion of the
starred problems, you should include output of several test runs
that demonstrates what your program does.
The electronic portion
should be sent to coen006@scudc.scu.edu (with subjects
"hw 6.4" and "hw 6.5", respectively).
The paper portion should
be placed in Dr. St. John's box in the Engineering Center.

<ol>
	<li> Below is the definition for the class <b>ShoeSize</b>.
	Write an appropriate definitions for the member functions
	<b>input()</b> and <b>output()</b>:
<pre>
class ShoeSize
{
    public:
        void input();    // Gets length and width by asking user.
        void output();   // Prints out the length and width.

    private:
        int length;       // Stores the length (i.e. 8, 9, 10, ...))
        char width;       // Stores the width (i.e. 'N' for Narrow,
                          // 'M' for medium, 'W' for wide)
};
</pre>

	<li> Write a definition for a structure type for records 
	consisting of a person's wage rate, accrued vacaction 
	(which some whole number of days), and status (which 
	is either hourly or salaried). Represent the status as one 
	of the two char values 'H' and 'S'.
	Call the type <b>EmployeeRecord</b>.

	<li> Suppose your program contains the following class definition
	(along with the definitions of the member functions):
<pre>
class YourClass
{
    public:
        YourClass(int new_info, char more_new_info);
        YourClass();
        void do_stuff();
    private:
        int information;
        char more_information;
};
</pre>
	Which of the following are legal?  Which are illegal?
	Explain which each one does or give reasons why it's illegal.
	
	<ol>
		<li type=a> <pre> YourClass an_object(42, 'A');</pre>
		<li type=a> <pre> YourClass another_object;</pre>
		<li type=a> <pre> YourClass yet_another_object();</pre>
		<li type=a> <pre> an_object = YourClass(99, 'B');</pre>
		<li type=a> <pre> an_object = YourClass();</pre>
		<li type=a> <pre> an_object = YourClass;</pre>
	</ol>

	<li>* Write a program to score the paper-rock-scissor game.
	Each of two users types in either <b>P</b>, <b>R</b>, or
	<b>S</b> and the program then announces the winner as well
	as the basis for determining the winner:
<pre>Paper covers rock, Rock breaks scisssors, 
Scissors cut paper, or Nobody wins</pre>
	Be sure to allow the users to use lowercase as well as 
	uppercase letters.  Your program should include a loop that
	the lets the users play again until the users say they are
	done.

	<li>* Write a program for grades for this course.  Use a
	class definition that
	has variables to contain the homework total, the
	lab total, the two midterm scores, and the final
        exam. 
	You may assume that all grades are whole numbers between
	0 and 100.
	Your class should have two public functions: one to get input
	and the other to print.  The print function should call a
	private "helper" function to calculate the grade (using the
	percentages from the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>).
        It should also have a default constructor that sets all values 
	to 0 and a member function print that prints out the class.

	<p>
	<b>Extra Credit:</b> When calculating grades, replace one of
	the midterm grades by the final, if the final grade is 
	higher.
