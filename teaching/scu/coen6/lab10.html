<b>Reversing a Linked List</b>
<hr>

In this lab, you need to write a <b>void</b>-function that 
takes a linked list of integers and reverses the order of 
its nodes.  The function will have one call-by-reference 
parameter that is a pointer to the head of the list.  After
the function is called a pointer will point to the head of
a linked list that has the same nodes as the original list,
but in the reverse order  they had in the original list.
Note that your function will neither create nor destroy 
any nodes.  It will simply rearrange the nodes.

<p>
You should use the following definitions for the nodes
and pointers to nodes:
<pre>
struct Node
{
    int data;
    Node *link;
};

typedef Node* NodePtr;
</pre>

Your linked list should follow the style that we discussed
in class and that is illustrated in the book: e.g. there
is a head node that contains no data and the ending node's
link is set to NULL. 

<p> 
Your program should prompt the user to enter as many integers
as the user wishes, it should then store the numbers in a
linked list, print out the linked list, call the reversing
function, and print out the linked list again (this time 
in reversed order).

<h3>Hints</h3>

The following functions might be useful in your implementation.
The first function takes the head of the list and returns a pointer
to the end node of the list.
<pre>
NodePtr endptr( NodePtr Head )
{
    NodePtr here = head;

    if ( here == NULL ) // Empty list case
    {
        return (NULL);
    }
    else 
    {
        while ( here->link != NULL)
            here = here->link;
        return( here );
    }
}
</pre>

This funcion prints out the linked list, from beginning to
end:
<pre>
void print( NodePtr Head )
{
    NodePtr here = head;

    if ( here == NULL ) // Empty list case
    {
        cout &lt&lt "\nList empty.\n\n";
    }
    else 
    {
        cout &lt&lt endl;
        do 
        {
            cout &lt&lt here->data &lt&lt " ";
            here = here->link;
        } while ( here != NULL)
        cout &lt&lt endl;
    }


}
</pre>

<h3>Testing </h3>

To test this program, you should run it on several
lists of integers that demonstrate that your program
reverses the linked list.

<h3>Program Style</h3>

Your program should have include a comment header with your
name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
you have made). The program should be properly indented
following the style discussed in class and illustrated in the
text. Besides the initial comments, you should include comments
for any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
self-evident. 

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>
        
Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
<ul>
    <li> a printout of your program, 
    <li> a printout of the interaction between you and the computer 
         when the program is run (see note on Testing above).
    <li> and you should mail a copy of your webpage program to 
         the class account (coen006) with the subject: "lab 10".
</ul>

If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the 
time to start the homework.
