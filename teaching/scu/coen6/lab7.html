<b>Implementing a Fraction Class</b>
<hr>

Design a class for fractions using the following class declaration;
do not modify, add, or remove any functions or variables from the
class.


<pre>
class Fraction
{
    public:
        friend Fraction operator+(const Fraction& num1, const Fraction& num2);
        friend Fraction operator-(const Fraction& num1, const Fraction& num2);
        friend Fraction operator*(const Fraction& num1, const Fraction& num2);
        friend Fraction operator/(const Fraction& num1, const Fraction& num2);
        friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& outs, const Fraction& num2);
        friend istream& operator>>(istream& ins, Fraction& num1);

        Fraction();                
        Fraction(int new_top, int new_btm);         
     
    private:
        int top, btm;
        int gcd(int u, int v);
};
</pre>

<h3>Simplifying Fractions</h3>

Any function that computes a new fraction (including constructors)
should store the fraction in its simplest form.  For example, "3/6"
should be stored as "1/2".  To do this, you need to find the greatest
common divisor of the numerator and denominator and divide both by
this number.  Use the following "helper" function to do this:
<pre>
int gcd(int u, int v)
{
    while (u > 0)
    {
        if ( u < v )
            swap(u,v);
        u = u-v;
    }
    return v;
}
</pre>
Note that you need also to include in your program the 
swap function we discussed in lecture.

<p>
Your main program should implement a four function calculator
that works with fractions.  Design it around a menu implemented
using a switch statement.  The menu should appear on the screen
as:
<pre>
Enter two fractions: 2/3 3/4

Press '*' for their product,
Press '/' for their quotient,
Press '+' for their sum,
Press '-' for their difference.

Please enter your selection: *

The result is: 1/2

Do you wish to repeat this? (y/n):
</pre>

<h3>Testing</h3>

To test this program, you should use the menu with a
few realistic test cases to see whether or not the
output is correct and in simplest form.

<h3>Program Style</h3>

        Your program should have include a comment header with your
        name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
        the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
        you have made). The program should be properly indented
        following the style discussed in class and illustrated in the
        text. Besides the initial comments, you should include comments
        for any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
        self-evident.

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>
        
        Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
        <ul>
                <li> a printout of your program
                <li> a printout of the interaction between you and the computer 
                        when the program is run (see section on Testing above).
                <li> and you should mail a copy of your webpage program to 
                        the class account (coen006) with the subject: "lab 7".
        </ul>

        If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the 
        time to start the homework.
