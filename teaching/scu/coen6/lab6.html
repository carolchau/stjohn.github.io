<h2>Laboratory 6</h2>
<h3>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br>
Introduction to Computing</h3>

<b>Classes: Roman Numbers</b>
<hr>

Write a program that accepts a year written as a four-digit
Arabic (ordinary) numeral and outputs the year written in
Roman numerals.  Important Roman numerals are: V for 5, 
X for 10, L for 50, D for 500, and M for 1000.  Recall that
some numbers are formed using a kind of subtraction of one 
Roman "digit": e.g. IV for 4 (produced as V minus I), XL is
40, CM is 900, et cetera.  A few sample years: MCM is 1900,
MCML is 1950, MCMLX is 1960, MCMXL is 1940, MCMLXXXIX is 1989.
Assume the year is between 1000 and 3000.  Your program should
include a loop that lets the user repeat this calculation
until the user says he or she is done.

<p>
Design your program around the class called "Year" described
as follows:
<pre>
class Year
{
    public:
        Year();                // Default Constructor
        Year(int num);         // Constructor with one (Arabic) constructor
        void Set(int num);     // Sets year to num
        void Display_Arabic(); // Outputs year as regular number
        void Display_Roman();  // Outputs year as Roman number
    private:
        // A prototype for your private "helper" function goes here...
        int arabic;            // The year stored as regular number
};
</pre>

<h3>Hints</h3>

The member function <b>Display_Roman()</b> will have much in 
common with the computing change program from 
<a href="lab3.html">lab 3</a>.  Recall that that program
determined the number of coins of each denomination that are needed
to add up to some amount between 0 and 99 cents.  
<b>Display_Roman()</b> should call a private "helper" function
similar in principle to the function <b>compute_coin()</b> that was 
used in lab 3; you will have to add a prototype for this function 
to your class definition.

<h3>Testing</h3>

Test your program with a few realistic sample cases to see whether
or not the output is correct.  Be sure that your tests include some
that use the subtraction technique, and be sure that you also test
every Roman digit.

<h3>Style and Comments</h3>

Your are expected to choose your identifiers in a way that suggest
their content.  Indentation should be used, following the style of
the book.  Unusual numbers which are not immediately recognizable
from their value, or numbers that appear in several places throughout
your code, should be replaced by named constants.

<p>
        Your program should have include a comment header with your
        name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
        the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
        you have made). The program should be properly indented
        following the style discussed in class and illustrated in the
        text. Besides the initial comments, you should include comments
        for any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
        self-evident.

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>
        
        Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
        <ul>
                <li> a printout of your program
                <li> a printout of the interaction between you and the computer 
                        when the program is run (see section on Testing above)
                <li> and you should mail a copy of your webpage program to 
                        the class account (coen006) with the subject: "lab 6".
       </ul>

        If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the 
        time to start the homework.
