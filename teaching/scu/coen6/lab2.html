Introduction to Computing</h3>

<b>Netscape, Mail, and the Game of Nim</b>
<hr>


<h3>Setting Up lab2 Directory</h3>

	
	At the beginning of every lab, you should make a subdirectory to 
	hold your work for that lab.  Change directories to your coen6
	subdirectory, create a new directory called "lab2", and change
	directories to your new subdirectory, lab2.  Recall, 
	to do this, you type (in a Unix Window):

	<pre>	cd coen6
	mkdir lab2
	cd lab2</pre>

	<p>
	It is often useful to go the parent directory of the one you
	are in.  To do this, you type:
	<pre>	cd ..</pre>
	This will take you back to the coen6 directory.  If you want
	to go back to your home, or starting, directory, you can do
	"cd .." again.  Since you often want to return to your home
	directory, there is a special command to do so.  It is:
	
	<pre>	cd ~</pre>
	This will take you back to your home directory, no matter where
	you are.


<h3>Playing Nim</h3>

	Today, we are going to write a program that plays the game of
	nim.
    	The game of nim starts with a whole number (between 1 and 50) of 
     playing sticks. The two players take turns subtracting 1, 2, or 3
     sticks from the pile. The player who takes the last stick loses. Write
     a program that takes a integer between 1 and 50 as input, and
     alternatively asks each player for the number of sticks (1, 2, or 3)
     they would like to remove from the pile. When the pile is empty, the
     program should announce which player is the winner.

	You should write an algorithm, test your algorithm, then write
	and test your program.

<h3>Program Style and Comments</h3>

	Your program should have include a comment header with your
	name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
	the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
	you have made).  The program should be properly indented following
	the style discussed in class and illustrated in the text.
	Besides the initial comments, you should include comments for
	any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
	self-evident.

<h3>Netscape</h3>

	All homeworks and labs are posted on the class webpage.  Before
	you leave lab, you should print out the next homework, since it
	will not be passed out.  To do this, you need to bring up Netscape.
	Click on the arrow above the "N" icon on the icon strip at the
	bottom of your screen (near the center of the strip).  Choose
	"Netscape 4.04".  It will take a little bit of time for Netscape
	to load.  If this is your first time using netscape from this 
	account, you will be see  several dialog boxes of greetings, before
	the main Netscape window appears.  When the main window appears,
	click on the "Open Page" option from the File menu.  Type in the
	URL (Universal Record Locator) for our class:
	
	<pre>	http://www.cse.scu.edu/~kstjohn/coen6/coen6.html</pre>

	From that page, click on "Homework 2."  To print Homework 2, 
	click on the Print icon at the top of the Netscape Window.  A
	dialog box will appear.  You will need to change the "Print Command"
	in that box to:
	
	<pre>	lp -d laser</pre>

	and then click on "Print" in the lower left hand corner of the
	box.  Netscape will send this to the line (or queue) of files
	waiting to be printed and will bring up a dialog box to tell you
	the number in line your file is.  Click on "OK" and get your 
	printout from the lab monitor (the laser printer is located
	directly behind the lab monitor's desk).  

<h3>Using Netscape Mail</h3>

	We will also use Netscape for mail.  Before using Netscape Mail,
	it is a good idea to check to see that the preferences are 
	correct.  To do this, click on "Preferences" under the Edit 
	Menu.  Next click on "Mail & Groups" under the Category bar on 
	the left.  Click on "Identity" and make sure that the name and 
	e-mail address are correct.  Next, click on "Mail Server", your
	user name should be the same as your login.  Your outgoing and
	incoming mail server should be "mail" (if you are setting this
	up at home, they should be "mail@scudc.scu.edu" and you should
	also click on "Leave messages on server").  Click on "OK", and
	you are now ready to use Netscape Mail.

	<p>
	To open Netscape mail, you can either click on the mail icon
	in the bottom right hand corner of Netscape or you can choose
	"Messenger Mailbox" from the Communicator menu.  To send a
	message, choose "New Msg".  In the "To:" box, type in:

	<pre>	coen006@scudc.scu.edu</pre>

	to send mail to the class account.  For a subject, you should
	type in:

	<pre>	lab 2</pre>

	We will use the subject to sort your homework and labs for 
	grading, so, you need to use exactly what is given as a subject
	to ensure your work is sorted correctly.
	
	<p>
	To include your homework, click on the "Attach" button and 
	choose "File..." from the submenu.  This will bring up a 
	dialog box from which you can choose the name of the file
	you would like to send.  You only need to send your source
	code (e.g. nim.cpp), not any of your captured interactions
	with the computer.
	
	
	<p>
	To see if you have any new mail while in Netscape Mail, click
	on the "Get Msg" button.  
	The class account will send an acknowledgment message (usually
	within 5 minutes) when 
	your work has been submitted.  Keep this message since it
	will be your proof that you turned in your homework. 

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>

	
	Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
	<ul>
		<li> a printout of the C++ file 
		<li> a printout of at least <b>2</b> interactions between
			between you and the computer when the
			nim program is run. 
	</ul>

	You should also mail a copy of your program only (no need to 
	mail the interactions) to 
	<pre> 	coen006</pre>
	with a subject of 
	<pre>	lab 2</pre>
	
	<p>
	If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the time 
	to start the homework.
