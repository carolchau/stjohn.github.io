<h3>Permissions</h3>

	On the Unix system, there are several different file types.
	The two we have discussed already are directories and text files.
	Each file has permissions associated with it.  The permissions
	indicate who may access the file.  To see these permissions, you 
	use the long form of the list command: 

	<pre>	ls -l</pre>

	For example, using this command on my lab1 directory gives:

	<pre>
	bash$ ls -l
	total 1296
	-rwx------   1 kstjohn    faculty     156321 Jan  7 18:29 bye
	-rw-------   1 kstjohn    faculty         86 Jan  7 18:28 bye.cpp
	-rw-------   1 kstjohn    faculty        127 Jan  7 18:29 bye.out
	-rwx------   1 kstjohn    faculty     156321 Jan  5 15:35 hello
	-rw-rw-r--   1 kstjohn    faculty         84 Jan  5 15:34 hello.cpp
	-rw-------   1 kstjohn    faculty        128 Jan  5 15:35 hello.out
	</pre>

	The first minus sign indicates this is a file (rather than a 
	directory).  The next three symbols on the first line (rwx)
	indicate that the owner has permission to read, write, execute
	this file.  The next 6 dashes indicate that no one else may
	read, write, or execute this file.  "Everyone else" is divided
	into 2 classes: those in your group (my group is faculty) and
	the rest of the world.  The third column lists the owner of
	the file (in this case, kstjohn), and the fourth column gives
	the group.  The next column gives the size of the file.  The
	next two give the day and time the file was last modified.  And
	the last column on the line has the name of the file.

	<p>
	As a rule, you will only want your files to be modified and
	executed by you.  Exceptions to this rule would be if you were
	sharing files for a group project or if the file was part of
	your website (which needs to be world readable if others are 
	to be allowed to look at it).  We will talk about permissions
	and how to change them in the next lab. 
	

<h3>Copying and Removing Files</h3>

	<p>
	At the beginning of every lab, you should make a subdirectory to 
	hold your work for that lab.  Change directories to your coen6
	subdirectory, create a new directory called "lab3", and change
	directories to your new subdirectory, lab3.  Recall, 
	to do this, you type (in a Unix Window):

	<pre>	cd coen6
	mkdir lab3
	cd lab3</pre>

	<p>
	It is often useful to copy files you have previously created.
	For example, to copy the file hello.cpp that we wrote in Lab 1
	into our lab3 directory, you type:

	<pre>	cd ../
	cp lab1/hello.cpp  lab3/hello.cpp </pre>

	This command says to change to the "parent directory" of our
	current directory.  Since we were in the lab1 subdirectory of
	the coen6 directory (often written: coen6/lab1), this moves us
	to the coen6 directory.  The coen6 directory should have at least
	three subdirectories: lab1, lab2, and lab3 
	(and some for the homework).  
	The second command, cp, copies the contents of the file 
	hello.cpp in the lab1 directory to a
	file with a same name in the lab2 directory.  

	<p>
	Change directories back to lab2 (e.g. cd lab2), and now let's
	copy the hello.cpp to a file named stats.cpp.  Since both the
	source file (hello.cpp) and the destination file (stats.cpp)
	are located in the same subdirectory, we only need to specify
	their names when we copy:

	<pre>	cp hello.cpp stats.cpp</pre>

	If you list the directory (ls), you should now see 2 files listed.
	We will modify the file stats.cpp for this lab.

	<p>
	To remove a file, you use the rm command.  For example, if we
	wanted to remove the object code bye from the lab 1 directory, 
	we would type:
	<pre>	rm bye	</pre>

	You should be certain that you no longer want a file when you
	remove it, since it is not possible to get the file back.


<h3>Statistics Program</h3>

	Write a program that asks the user to enter 4 numbers and
	then returns the average, the standard deviatation, the 
	minimum number, and the maximum number.  Your program should
	use a function for each of these calculations.  Each of 
	these functions should take the numbers the user entered
	and return the desired answer.  For the standard deviation
	function, you should also have the average as one of the
	parameters for the function.	

	<p>
        You should write an algorithm, test your algorithm, then write
        and test your program.

<h3>Program Style and Comments</h3>

        Your program should have include a comment header with your
        name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
        the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
        you have made).  The program should be properly indented following
        the style discussed in class and illustrated in the text.
        Besides the initial comments, you should include comments for
        any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
        self-evident.

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>


        Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
        <ul>
                <li> a printout of the C++ file
                <li> a printout of at least <b>2</b> interactions between
                        between you and the computer when the
                        nim program is run.
        </ul>

        You should also mail a copy of your program only (no need to
        mail the interactions) to
        <pre>   coen006</pre>
        with a subject of
        <pre>   lab 3</pre>

        <p>
        If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the time
        to start the homework.
