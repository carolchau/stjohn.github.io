<h2>Laboratory 5</h2>
<h3>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br>
Introduction to Computing</h3>
<hr>
<b>C++ File Handling</b>

<hr>

In today's lab, we're going to write two different
programs, both that work with files.  Do the double-spacing
program first, then go on to work on the webpage
generating program.

<h3>Double spacing a file</h3>

Write a program that asks the user for the name
of an input file and for the name of an output
file.  The program should store in the output
file a double-spaced version of the input file.

<h3>Testing and Script</h3>

To test this program, you should run it on several
different input files.  You can either create these
files or use ones that are already in your directory.
For example, you could double space the source code
that created the program.  

<p>
To document that your program is double-spacing
the files, a useful UNIX command to use is <b>cat</b>.
<b>cat</b> lists a file to the screen.  So, if you
want to document the double spacing of the file 
sample.in into the output file double.out, you would
type:
<pre>
script lab5a.out
cat sample.in
double
cat double.out
exit
</pre>
(assuming your program's object code is called double).


<h3>Program that Generates Webpages</h3>

The second program for today's lab should generate 
a simple webpage for the user.  The program should
store this page in <b>simple.html</b>.  Your program
should ask the user for
<ul>
	<li> their first name (up to 10 characters)
	<li> their last name (up to 15 characters)
	<li> their email address (up to 25 characters)
	<li> their favorite color (give 4 choices from which
		to choose) 
</ul>
For the choice of color, your program should check to see that
their choice is legal and if not, prompt them to enter again until their
choice is legal.
Your program should generate a page that has the
following:
<ul>
	<li> a title including their first name 
	<li> the background color set their chosen color 
	<li> a heading at the top of the page with the user's first
	and last name in it
	<li> a "mailto" link to their e-mail address
	<li> a link to the Design Center
</ul>

<h3>Program Style</h3>

        Both programs should have include a comment header with your
        name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
        the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
        you have made). The programs should be properly indented
        following the style discussed in class and illustrated in the
        text. Besides the initial comments, you should include comments
        for any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
        self-evident.

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>
        
        Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
        <ul>
                <li> a printout of your double spacing program, 
                        with the program header comment
                        correctly filled in (with your name and e-mail) 
                        and all syntax errors removed.
                <li> a printout of the interaction between you and the computer 
                        when the double spacing program is run 
                <li> and you should mail a copy of your double spacing program to 
                        the class account (coen006) with the subject: "lab 5a".
                <li> a printout of your webpage generating program, 
                        with the program header comment
                        correctly filled in (with your name and e-mail) 
                        and all syntax errors removed.
                <li> a printout of the source (the HTML file) of your webpage.
                <li> a printout of your webpage as viewed from Netscape 
                        (see <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.
                        for directions on printing pages in Netscape).
                <li> and you should mail a copy of your webpage program to 
                        the class account (coen006) with the subject: "lab 5b".
        </ul>

        If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the 
        time to start the homework.
