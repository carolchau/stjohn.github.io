Examples of user-defined functions:

<b>convert2.cxx:</b>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt

// Yet another conversion program

// Jean Potatohead

//
// Program converts the user's input from miles to kilometers
// using the function convert.

float convert( float miles_par );
// Takes miles as input, and returns the equivalent number
// of kilometers.  Assumes the input is a float.


main()
{
    float miles,        // stores the miles the user entered
        km;             // stores the conversion to km


    cout &lt&lt "Please enter the number of miles: ";

    cin &gt&gt miles;       // Store the number in miles
    km = convert(miles);// Function that converts miles to km

    cout &lt&lt "The number of kilometers is " &lt&lt km &lt&lt ".\n";

<b>Group work (from 12 January):</b>
<hr>
An employee is paid at the rate of $16.78 per hour for
regular hours worked in a week.  Any hours over that are
paid at the overtime rate of one and one half times that.
From the worker's gross pay 6 percent is withheld for
social security tax, 14 percent is withheld for federal
income tax, 5 percent is withheld for state income tax, 
and $10 withheld for union dues.  If the work has 3 or more
dependents, then an additional $35 per week is withheld
to cover the extra cost of health insurance.  Write a
program that will read in the number of hours worked in
a week and the number of dependents as input, and will
then output the worker's gross pay, each withholding
amount, and the net take-home pay.

<b>A program to solve this, using functions (see
