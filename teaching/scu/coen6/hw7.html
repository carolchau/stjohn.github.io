<h2>Homework 7</h2>
<h2>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br> 
Introduction to Computing</h2>


<hr>
<b>Now due by noon, Monday, 9 March.)</b><br>
<b>(Originally due by noon, Thursday, 5 March.)</b><br>
The starred problems include programming and should be submitted
both electronically and on paper.  In the paper portion of the
starred problems, you should include output of several test runs
that demonstrates what your program does.
The electronic portion
should be sent to coen006@scudc.scu.edu (with subjects
"hw 7.4" and "hw 7.5", respectively).
The paper portion should
be placed in Dr. St. John's box in the Engineering Center.

<ol>
	<li> Write a function that takes as its arguments a 
	character array that ends in a '\0' (that is, a string) 
	and prints the string <b>backwards</b> to the screen. 	

	<li> What is the output of the following pieces of code:
        <ol>
                <li type=a>
                <pre>
int *p, *q, x, y;

x = 10;
y = 20;

p = &x;
q = &y;
cout &lt&lt "x and y are " &lt&lt x &lt&lt " and " &lt&lt y &lt&lt ".\n";
cout &lt&lt "*p and *q are " &lt&lt *p &lt&lt " and " &lt&lt *q &lt&lt ".\n";
                </pre>

                <li>
                <pre>
int *p, *q, x, y;

x = 10;
y = 20;

p = &x;
q = &y;
*p = 30;
cout &lt&lt "x and y are " &lt&lt x &lt&lt " and " &lt&lt y &lt&lt ".\n";
cout &lt&lt "*p and *q are " &lt&lt *p &lt&lt " and " &lt&lt *q &lt&lt ".\n";
                </pre>
                <li>
                <pre>
int *p, *q, x, y;

x = 10;
y = 20;

p = &x;
q = &y;
y = 40;
*p = *q;
cout &lt&lt "x and y are " &lt&lt x &lt&lt " and " &lt&lt y &lt&lt ".\n";
cout &lt&lt "*p and *q are " &lt&lt *p &lt&lt " and " &lt&lt *q &lt&lt ".\n";
                </pre>

                <li>
                <pre>
int *p, *q, x, y;

x = 10;
y = 20;

p = &x;
q = &y;
p = q;
x = 50;
cout &lt&lt "x and y are " &lt&lt x &lt&lt " and " &lt&lt y &lt&lt ".\n";
cout &lt&lt "*p and *q are " &lt&lt *p &lt&lt " and " &lt&lt *q &lt&lt ".\n";
                </pre>

        </ol>


	<li> What is the output of the following program? 
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt
void cheers(int n);
int main()
{
    cheers(3);
    return 0;
}

void cheers(int n)
{
    if ( n == 1 )
    {
        cout &lt&lt "Hurray\n";
    }
    else
    {
        cout &lt&lt "Hip ";
        cheers(n - 1);
    }
}
</pre>

	<li>* Write a C++ program to handle complex numbers. 
	Your program should have a class definition <b>ComplexNumber</b> and
        should have the operators: 

<pre> +, *, << </pre>

        overloaded for your type ComplexNumber. 
	Your program should ask the user for two numbers and then print 
	the sum and product of those two numbers. Your program should allow 
	the user to repeat this as often as he or she wishes.  

	<li>* Write a program that will allow two users to play
	tic-tac-toe.  The program should ask for moves alternately
	from player X and player O.  The program should display the
	game positions as follows:
<pre>
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9
</pre>
	Use a two dimensional array to hold the game board.
	The players enter their moves by entering the position number
	they wish to mark.  After each move, the program displays the
	changed board and ask if the game should continue.  You should
	also have a loop that allows the users to play as many games as they
	wish. 
	
	<p>
	A sample board configuration is:
<pre>
X  X  O
4  5  6
O  8  9
</pre>
	<b>Extra Credit:</b>	Check after each move to see if the
	player has won the game.  If the player has won, announce the
	winner and ask if they players would like to play again.
	Recall that a player has won if they have 3 squares in a row
	horizontally, vertically, or on the diagonal.
