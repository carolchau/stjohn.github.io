<h1> Hints for Lab 5</h1>
<h2> Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br>
Introduction to Computing</h2>

<br>

<hr>
Lab 5 has two programs: one to double space a file and one
to produce html files.  Due to confusion and problems with
the equipment, the due date for this lab has been extended until 
Monday at noon (to Dr. St. John's box).  
<hr>

<b>Double-Spacing </b><br>
The idea behind this program is to take an input file (specified
by the user) and make a double spaced copy of it in the output
file (also specified by the user).  To do this, we will need
to read in one file character by character and print those 
characters out (with an extra carriage return at the end of
lines) to other file.  Since "&gt&gt" ignores spaces, we have
to use the member function get() of ifstream.  If c is of type
char and fin is the ifstream, we would write

<pre>fin.get(c);</pre>

to get a single character (including things like spaces and
carriage returns).  To write this to a file is the same as before
(assume the ofstream is fout):

<pre>fout &lt&lt c;</pre>

<p>
The pseudocode for this is:
<pre>

// declare in and out file streams
// declare in and out file names

// ask user for name of in and out files
// open these files (see Friday's lecture notes or p.227 of the text)

// assuming c is of type char and fin and fout are the streams:

while ( fin.get(c) )  // can also use !fin.eof() as the test 
                      // and put fin.get(c) in the loop
{
    fout &lt&lt c;
    if ( c == '\n' )
        fout &lt&lt '\n';
}

// close files
</pre>

<b>Webpage Generating Program</b><br>
For the HTML file generator, there is only an output file called
<b>simple.html</b>.  The idea for this program is to generate 
pages like the one you wrote last week.  Using the users' information
(name, color, etc.), you create the page.  
Since much of this program is similar to template.html from last
week, you might want to
cut and paste the template page from last time, to save typing it all in
again.  The pseudocode should look something like:

<pre>
// declare output file stream, and strings to hold first name, last name, etc

// open file stream to simple.html.  Assume the file stream is called fout

// echo beginning line to file (that is the html for title):

    fout &lt&lt "&lt;title&gt";

// ask for user's first name and store it, in say first, then echo that:

    fout &lt&lt first &lt&lt "'s Page&lt;/title&gt";

// for color, the user can enter a number depending on what color, and
// you can put in a simple if statement (or use what Arjun suggests below):

    if (color == 1) // wants the color "red"
		fout &lt&lt "bgcolor=0000ff";
    if (color == 2) // wants the next color ...

// use the same idea with all the information, for example:

    fout &lt&lt "&lt;heading&gt " &lt&lt first &lt&lt " " &lt&lt last 
         &lt&lt "'s Page&lt;/heading&gt";

// close file after all the html commands have been entered.
