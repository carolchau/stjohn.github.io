<b>Group work:</b>
<hr>
An employee is paid at the rate of $16.78 per hour for
regular hours worked in a week.  Any hours over that are
paid at the overtime rate of one and one half times that.
From the worker's gross pay 6 percent is withheld for
social security tax, 14 percent is withheld for federal
income tax, 5 percent is withheld for state income tax, 
and $10 withheld for union dues.  If the work has 3 or more
dependents, then an additional $35 per week is withheld
to cover the extra cost of health insurance.  Write a
program that will read in the number of hours worked in
a week and the number of dependents as input, and will
then output the worker's gross pay, each withholding
amount, and the net take-home pay.
