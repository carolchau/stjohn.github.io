<ul>
	<li> <b>Grading:</b> The grading for the course will be based on:
		<ul>
			<li> Laboratory:	10%
			<li> Homework:		15%
			<li> Midterm Exam 1:	20%
			<li> Midterm Exam 2:	25%
			<li> Final Exam:	30%
		</ul>
	<li> <b>Exams:</b>  The exams will be 
		<ul>
			<li> Midterm Exam 1: Monday, 26 January in class.
			<li> Midterm Exam 2: During 8th week of class, TBA.
			<li> Final Exam: Friday, 20 March, 9:10-12:10.
		</ul>
		You must pass the final to pass the class.  Since the
		final is comprehensive, if you do better on it than on one
		of the midterm exams, the score on the final may replace
		one of the midterm scores.  Note that the final will be
		long and difficult, so, it is an exceptionally bad idea to
		plan on taking advantage of this.

	<li> <b>Assignments:</b> Lab assignments are due at the end of each
		laboratory period, unless specifically told otherwise.  
		Homework assignments are due Thursdays at noon.  Late 
		assignments will have 
		25 percent of their score deducted for each day late.

	<li> <b>Attendance:</b> Attendance in lecture and laboratory is
		mandatory. 

	<li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
		overall design of the programs and homework.  However, for 
		specific
		programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.
		See Undergraduate Handbook for more 
		information about the School of Engineering Honor Code.
