<h3>Announcements:</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Check <a href="exam2">here</a> for information about the
		second exam.  <a href="ex2ans.pdf">Answers</a> for the
		exam. 

	<li> Homework 7 (due 5 March) contains a question on pointers (#2).
		Pointers will not be covered in lecture until 4 March.  So,
		the due date for Homework 7 will be postponed until Monday,
		9 March.  Note that the due date for Homework 8 will <b>not</b>
		be postponed, so, you should do as much of Homework 7 as
		early as you can.

	<li> You must save all graded work from this class (e.g. homework,
		lab exercises, midterms) and turn it back in at the final
		exam.  The School of Engineering will be going through
		ABET accreditation next Fall.  In preparation, the school
		is required to put together a complete set of materials
		for this course.

	<li> The four-year plan recommends that COEN majors take the 
		required COEN 70 course in the spring of their sophomore year.  
		<b>Next year, however, they should take this course in the
		Fall.</b>  Currently, there will be two sections in the
		Fall, and none in the Spring.

	<li> According to the recent changes to the COEN requirements, 
		COEN 21 will move from the sophomore year to the
		freshmen year in the four-year plan.  This means that
		next year, COEN 21 will be taken by both this year's
		freshmen (who are following the old plan) and next
		year's freshmen (who will be following the new
		plan).

		<br> Since there are going to be extra students (next
		year's freshmen) who will try to take COEN 21 next
		spring, it is <b>very important</b> that next year's
		sophomores be advised to register for COEN 21 next
		fall instead of the folowing spring.  There are four
		sections of COEN 21 scheduled for next year.  Two in
		the fall, and one each in the winter and spring.

	<li> Dr. St. John will be in Europe from 24 February to 
		8 March.  (She's giving a talk at the Symposium
		on the Theorectical Aspects of Computer Science
		(<a href="http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~stacs98/">STACS 98</a>) 
		and attending a meeting on Logic, Computability and Complexity
		(<a href="http://www.wins.uva.nl/
		projects/pion/LCC98/">LCC</a>).)

		<br>
		Her office hours will be cancelled Weeks 8 and 9
		(23 February to 5 March).  Arjun, Erik, and Shannon will
		hold extra office hours in the Design center for those
		two weeks only:
		<ul>
			<li> Erik: Tuesdays 2-3 pm
			<li> Shannon: Wednesdays 1-2 pm
			<li> Arjun: Fridays 11-12 pm (plus his normal
			office hour of Friday 1-2 in his office).
