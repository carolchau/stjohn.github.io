<h1>Homework 1</h1>
<h1>Computer Engineering 6</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Computing</h2>
<h2>Winter 1998</h2>
<hr>
The homework is due by noon on Thursday, 15 January to Dr. St. John's
mailbox in the Engineering Center.  25%  of the score will be
deducted for each day late.  Starred exercises (*) require programming.
<hr>

<ol>
	<li> What does the following program do?
	
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt

// Mystery program

main()
{
    int count;
    
    count = 0;
    cout &lt&lt "H";
    do {
        cout &lt&lt "h";
        count = count + 1;
    } while ( count < 3 );
    cout &lt&lt "elp!!!\n";
}

</pre>

	<li> Write an algorithm (step-by-step directions) on how to make a paper
     	airplane. Include a sample of your airplane, labelled with your name
     	and paperclipped to your homework. Make sure to include any conditions
     	you assume and to make the instructions precise (a good way to test
     	this is to have a friend work through your instructions).
     
  	<li> What is the result of the following commands (assuming they are
     	embedded in an appropriate program):
    	<ol>
       		<li type=a> 
       
	<pre>num = 10;
cout &lt&lt "The number of students is " &lt&lt num &lt&lt "\n";</pre>
	
			<li type=a>
		
	<pre>cout &lt&lt 1 &lt&lt endl;
cout &lt&lt "1 1\n 1 2 1\n 1 3 3 1\n";</pre>
	
			<li type=a>		
	<pre>cout &lt&lt "1+1 " &lt&lt 1+2 &lt&lt "  " &lt&lt 1+3 &lt&lt endl; </pre>		
     	</ol>
     	     	
	<li>* Given the problem: print the average of two numbers entered by the
     user.
     	<ol>
     	
     		<li type=a> Write an algorithm (in English) to solve this problem. 
     			Include any
          		conditions on the input (for example, what type of numbers you
          		expect). (Again, you might want to have a friend work through it).
			<li type=a> Translate your algorithm into a working C++ program. Make
				 sure you include comments in your program. Include a printout of 
				 your C++ program and several interactions or runs of your program.
		</ol>
		
	<li>* Take the program "hello, world" discussed in class, and change it so it
     	will repeat the greeting as often as the user wishes.  After each greeting,
     	your program should ask if the user would like another greeting.  Each greeting
     	and question should be on separate lines,
     	and the program should have appropriate comments. Include a printout of your 
     	C++ program and several interactions or runs of your program.

</ol>
