<h3>Computer Engineering 6, Winter 1998<br>
Introduction to Computing</h3>

<b>Palindromes</b>
<hr>

A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forward and
backwards, such as "radar".  Write a program that will accept
a string of letters terminated whether or not the word (without
the period) is a palindrome.  You may assume that the input
contains only lowercase letters and that the input word is
at most twenty letters long.  Your program need not check that
the words are actually English words.  The word "aabbcbbaa"
will be considered a palindrome by your program.  Include
a loop that allows the user to check additional words until
the user requests that the program ends.


<h3>Hint</h3>

You do not need to use structures or classes to do this 
program, but you will need arrays.

<h3>Testing </h3>

To test this program, you should run it on several
realistic strings that are both palindromes and not
palindromes.  

<h3>Program Style</h3>

Your program should have include a comment header with your
name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
you have made). The program should be properly indented
following the style discussed in class and illustrated in the
text. Besides the initial comments, you should include comments
for any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
self-evident. 

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>
        
Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
<ul>
    <li> a printout of your program, 
    <li> a printout of the interaction between you and the computer 
         when the program is run (see note on Testing above).
    <li> and you should mail a copy of your webpage program to 
         the class account (coen006) with the subject: "lab 8".
</ul>

If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the 
time to start the homework.
