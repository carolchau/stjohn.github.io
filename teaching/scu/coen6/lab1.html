<h3>Login and Password</h3>

	As a student in the Engineering School, you have an account
	for the machines in the Design Center.  Your login is usually
	your first initial followed by the first 7 letters of your
	last name.  Your initial password is usually set to your
	student ID number or your social security number (not
	including the dashes).  For example, if your name was Jean
	Potatohead and your social security number was 123-45-6789,
	then your login would be jpotatoh and your initial password
	would be 123456789.

	<p> As a student at Santa Clara University, you are entitled
	to accounts on the Alpha mainframe ("scuacc") and on the
	Novell Groupwise mail system ("mailer").  While the account
	names on these machines will be similar to your account in
	the Design Center, these are separate accounts.  Changing
	your password on these accounts will not change the password
	for your Design Center account.

	<p> Find an empty HP computer in the Design Center, and type
	your login and password at the prompts.  If this is the first
	time you have used one of the HP computers running CDE
	(Common Desktop Environment) in the lab, then you will first
	see an introduction to the Design Center.  Read the message,
	and dismiss the window by clicking on the button at the
	bottom of the window.  Your screen should now have a strip of
	icons along the bottom of the screen.  Towards the right end
	of the strip, there is an icon with a picture of a computer
	with a large "X" on the screen.  Click on that icon, and then
	choose "Local XTerm".  This will bring up a Unix window, in
	which you can enter the Unix commands described below.  If
	you have problems, contact the TA or lab assistant.

<h3>Changing Passwords</h3>

	You should change your password on a regular basis.  Choose a
	password you can easily remember, but which no one else can
	guess.  Do not use names or words, and use at least one
	non-alphabetic character.  To change your password, type:

	<pre>   passwd</pre>

	and press the return key.  The computer will ask you for your
	old password and to type your new password twice.  On some
	machines, the new password might not take affect until
	midnight.

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

	When you finish today, you should "log off" the machine.  
	Logging off closes all your windows and keeps others from
	accessing your files.	
	To do this on the HP Machines, you click on the "exit"
	icon on the far right of the icon strip.  


<h3>Using Unix</h3>

	For this class, we will be using machines that run the Unix
	operating system.  We'll begin with some basic Unix
	commands.  Your account contains files and directories that
	contain either files or other directories.  Directories, like
	file folders, are used to organize files so they can be more
	easily found.  They are not required (just like it's not
	required that the stacks of papers on your desk be in file
	folders), but they are very useful.  To list all the files in
	the current directory, you type:

	<pre>   ls</pre>

	Try it now.  Even if you have not used this account before,
	there should be some files put there by the system
	adminstrators to get things started.

	<p> You should keep all of your files for this class in a
	subdirectory called coen6.  To create this new directory,
	type:

	<pre>   mkdir coen6</pre>

	After doing this, list your current directory again (ls).
	You should see in that list your new directory coen6.  To
	work in that directory, we need to change directories, by
	typing:

	<pre>   cd coen6</pre>

	You should also have a subdirectory for each lab and
	homework.  Create a directory for today's lab, by typing:

	<pre>   mkdir lab1</pre>

	and change directories to lab1.

	<p> To check which directory you are in, there is a Unix
	command to print the working directory, called pwd.  Check to
	see that you are in the lab1 directory with pwd.  It should
	print something that ends with "/coen6/lab1".

<h3>Using Gnu C++</h3>

	Now were are ready to compile and run a C++ program.  We will
	use the Gnu C++ Compiler, called g++, for this, and the HP
	text editor to enter the information.  You can bring up the
	editor by clicking on the icon towards the right of the icon
	strip (with the picture of a calculator and other tools) 
	and choosing "Text Editor".   To use the editor,
	click on the window and start typing.  If you encounter
	difficulties, ask the TA to show you how to use the editor.

	<p> Our first program will be the "hello, world" we discussed
	in lecture.  Each program should start with a comment
	containing the assignment name (e.g. "lab 1, part 1" or "hw
	1, problem 4"), the author, their e-mail address, and the honesty
	pledge, as well as a brief description of what the program
	does.  Using the editor, type in the following program,
	replacing your name and e-mail address for Jean Potatohead's
	name and address.

<pre> #include &lt;iostream.h&gt

// Laboratory Exercise 1, Part 1 ("hello world")
//
// Jean Potatohead
// jpotatoh@scudc.scu.edu
//
// I, Jean Potatohead, pledge that this program in my own independent
// work and conforms to the academic honor code.
//
// This program prints "hello world" to the screen.

main()
{
    cout &lt&lt "hello world" &lt&lt endl;
}
</pre>

	After typing this in, save it to a file, called hello.cpp, in
	your lab1 directory.  To save the file, choose the "Save"
	option from the "File" menu at the top of the window.  In the
	dialog box, click on coen6 (to choose your coen6 directory)
	and then click on update.  Next, click on lab1 (to choose
	your lab1 directory) and then click on update.  In the box
	for filename, type "hello.cpp" (without the quotes).  We add
	the ".cpp" at the end of the file to indicate that it's a C++
	program.  Other extensions used to indicate that a file is a
	C++ program include ".C", ".cc", ".cxx", and ".g++".

	<p> To compile your program, type (in the Unix Window):

	<pre>   g++ -Wall hello.cpp -o hello</pre>

	What does this line do?  The "g++" at the beginning of the
	line asks the computer to run the Gnu C++ compiler.  The
	"-Wall" is a switch to the compiler that asks it to list all
	warning messages that the compiler generates.  Warning
	messages often indicate programming errors.  In this class,
	no program will be considered correct if it generates warning
	messages.  In the middle of the line is the name of the file
	("hello.cpp") that we are compiling.  At the end, is another
	switch, "-o hello", that tells the compiler to put the
	results (the object code) of the compilation in the file
	"hello".  If we leave off this last switch, the compiler
	places the results in a file called a.out.  Since we're going
	to compile more than one program, it is much more useful to
	put the object code in a file with a meaningful name.

	<p> To compile another program, we just change the name of
	the file and the location for the object code.  For example,
	if we have a C++ program in the file, me.cc, then to compile,
	you type:

	<pre>   g++ -Wall me.cc -o me </pre>

	<p> If there are errors in your program, the computer will
	print them to the screen.  Before you can run your program,
	you must fix all the errors.  If you encounter difficulties,
	ask the TA for help.  If the g++ command returns without
	messages, your compilation has been successful, and you can
	run your program.

	<p> To run a program, you type the filename of the object
	code.  So, for our hello program, you would type:

	<pre>   hello</pre>

	The computer should then print "hello world" to the screen.

<h3>Printing Files and Capturing Output</h3>

	To print your program, hello.cpp, to the printer in the
	Design Center, you type:

	<pre>   lp hello.cpp</pre>

	To print a copy of the interaction between you and the
	computer when you run the program, you first need to capture
	this interaction to a file.  To do this, you must type a
	special command before running your program, and another
	after.  For example, if you would like to capture the output
	of hello.cpp to the file hello.out, you would type:  

<pre> 	
   script hello.out 
   hello
   exit    </pre>

	<p> You can then print the file hello.out using the lp
	command:

	<pre>   lp hello.out    </pre>


<h3>What to Turn In</h3>

	Following the above directions, create a program that says
	"goodbye world" and does nothing else.  Save the C++ program
	in a file called bye.cpp.

	<p> In the future, you will have to turn in an electronic
	version of your work.  The second lab will cover how to do
	this.  For now, you need only turn in a printed version of
	the program and a captured program interaction.

	<p> Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:  

	<ul>

		<li> a printout of the file hello.cpp, with the
			program header comment correctly filled in
			(with your name and e-mail) and all syntax
			errors removed.

		<li> a printout of the interaction between you and
			the computer when the hello program is run
			(e.g. a printout of hello.out).

		<li> a printout of the file bye.cpp, with the program
			header comment correctly filled in (with your
			name and e-mail) and all syntax errors
			removed.

		<li> a printout of the interaction between you and
			the computer when the goodbye program is run
			(e.g. a printout of bye.out).

	</ul>

	If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the
	time to start the homework.
