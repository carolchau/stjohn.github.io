<h3>Basic HTML</h3>

	Part of today's lab is to create your own web page.
	Most web pages are written using the language, HTML,
	which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  There are many
	similarities between C++ and HTML.  For example, in C++,
	curly braces "{" and "}" come in pairs and mark the beginning
	and end of functions or blocks of code.  For HTML, the beginning
	and end of the title (which appears at the top of the window)
	is indicated by "&lt;title&gt" and "&lt;/title&gt", and the
	beginning and end of a string written in a boldface font by
	"&lt b &gt" and "&lt /b &gt".  The title of this file is 
	written as:
	<pre>
	&lt;title&gt Lab 4 for Computer Engineering 6, SCU &lt;/title&gt
	</pre>
	
	<p>
	Every web page should begin with it's title, followed by the 
	body statement.  Like with the title, there's a beginning of 
	the body ("&lt;body&gt") and an end of the body ("&lt;body&gt").
	In between these two, you should put the body, or main part,
	of your webpage.  The body statement for this page has some
	extra "adjectives" which also specify the color of the page 
	and the links:

	<pre>
	&lt;body bgcolor="ffffff" link="003399" vlink="236b8e"&gt
	</pre>
	
	These extra descriptions occur only in the beginning body 
	statement, not the ending one.  "bgcolor" specifies the 
	background color of the page ("ffffff" is the hexadecimal
	representation for white), "link" gives the color of links,
	and "vlinks" gives the colors links turn after you have looked
	at them at least once.
	
	The end of body statement
	is just:
	
	<pre>
	&lt;/body&gt
	</pre>
	
	Comments in HTML are indicated by surrounding your comment
	with "&lt;!--" and "--&gt;".

<h3>Viewing the Source</h3>

	You can view the source for any webpage.  To do this, choose
	the "Page Source" option under the View Menu.  This will bring
	up a window with the HTML source code for the page you are 
	currently looking at (Note:  Different versions of Netscape
	put the "View Source" under different menus.  If you are not
	using Netscape 4.04, try also under the "Edit" menu.).
	
	For today's lab, a template, or sample, page has already been
	written.  You need to get a copy of it, save it in your directory,
	and modify it (one easy way to do this is to view the source and
	cut-and-paste it into
	an open text-edit window) .  
	The template file is 
	<a href="http://www.cse.scu.edu/~kstjohn/coen6/template.html">
	http://www.cse.scu.edu/~kstjohn/coen6/template.html</a>
	Note that the name of the file ends in ".html".  This indicates
	that it is a HTML file.
	You need to save the source file, not just the page, since saving
	just the page will not give you the HTML commands.
	
	
<h3>Creating your Page</h3>
	
	In the text editor, change the title, your name, 
	your e-mail address, and the background color
	(The next section includes representations for some
	colors.). 

	<p>
	Save your file as "sample.html."  To look at your file, 
	choose "Open" from the File menu.  In the dialog box, click
	the "File" option at the far right.  From there, choose your
	file from the folders.  
	 
	<p>
	If you change something in your file, save it, and then click
	on the "Reload" button.  This will bring up the latest version
	of your file.

<h3>Colors in HTML</h3>

	Colors are represented by a 6-digit hexadecimal number.  A hexadecimal
	number ranges from 0 to 15 (10 through 15 are represented by 
	A through F), much like a binary digit ranges from 0 to 1, or
	a decimal digit ranges from 0 to 9..  

	<p>
	"ffffff" represents the color white, while "000000" represents
	the color black.  Try changing the background color of your 
	page to get blue, red, and green.  You can do this by trial-and-error,
	looking at the source for other pages that use those colors, or
	by using a webpage editor such as Composer.


<h3>Make Your Page Visible to the Outside World</h3>

	Right now, your page is not viewable by anyone but you.  To make
	it visible, you need to change the permissions to allow others
	to read it (permissions were discussed in the last lab).  
	If you would like others to find your
	page easily, it's a good idea to link it to the 
	student homepage list maintained by the Design Center.  
	<p>
	This is not required for this class, but if you are interested
	in making your page visible to others, read the Design Center's
	Information page about what to do 
	<a href="http://www.scudc.scu.edu/info">
	http://www.scudc.scu.edu/info</a>.
	
	 	
<h3>Computing Change Program</h3>

        Write a program that tells what coins to give out for
        any amount of change from 1 cent to 99 cents.  For example,
        if the amount is 86 cents, the output would be something
        like the following:
<pre>
        86 cents can be given as
        3 quarter(s) 1 dime(s) and 1 penny(pennies)
</pre>
        Use coin denominations of 25 cents (quarters), 10 cents
        (dimes), and 1 cent (pennies).  Do not use nickel and
        half-dollar coins.  Your program will use the follwing
        function (among others):
<pre>
void compute_coin(int coin_value, int& number, int& amount_left);
// Assumes: 0 < coin_value < 100; 0 <= amount_left < 100.
// The function sets number equal to the maximum number of coins
// of coin_value cents that can be obtained from amount_left cents.
// amount_left is decreased by the value of the coins
// (i.e. number*coin_value).
</pre>


        Include a loop that lets the user repeat this computation
        for new input values until the user says he or she wants
        to end the program.  Hint: use integer division and the
        % operator to implement the above function.


<h3>Program style and what to turn in from lab3</h3>

	Your program should have include a comment header with your
	name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
	the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
	you have made). The program should be properly indented
	following the style discussed in class and illustrated in the
	text. Besides the initial comments, you should include comments
	for any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
	self-evident.  

<!-- sample comment -->

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>

	Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
	<ul>
		<li> a printout of your webpage as viewed from Netscape 
			(see <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.
			for directions on printing pages in Netscape).
		<li> a printout of the source (the HTML file) of your webpage.
		<li> a printout of your change computing program, 
			with the program header comment
			correctly filled in (with your name and e-mail) 
			and all syntax errors removed.
		<li> a printout of the interaction between you and the computer 
			when the change computing program is run 
			(e.g. a printout of hello.out).
		<li> and you should mail a copy of your C++ program 
			<b>only</b> to 
			the class account (coen006) with the subject: "lab 4".
	</ul>

	If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the 
	time to start the homework.
