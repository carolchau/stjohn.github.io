<b>Sorting using Recursion </b>
<hr>

Write a recursive function to sort an array of integers
into ascending order using the following idea: Place the
smallest element in the first position, then sort the
rest of the array by a recursive call.  

<p>
This is a recursive version of the selection sort algorithm
discussed in Chapter 9.  Note that simply taking the program
from Chapter 9 and plugging in the recursive version of
index_of_smallest (discussed in the text) will not suffice.
The function to do the sorting must itself be recursive 
and not merely use a recursive function. 

<p>
Your program should read in upto 25 integers and store
them in an array, call your sorting function, and then
print out the sorted list of integers.

<h3>Testing </h3>

To test this program, you should run it on several
different lists of numbers that demonstrate that the
sort is working.  Some good choices would be a randomly
ordered list, an ascending list (e.g. one already in order),
and a descending list (e.g. one in reverse order).

<h3>Program Style</h3>

Your program should have include a comment header with your
name, e-mail, honesty pledge, and a short description of what
the program does (including any assumptions, or preconditions,
you have made). The program should be properly indented
following the style discussed in class and illustrated in the
text. Besides the initial comments, you should include comments
for any aspect of your algorithm or implementatation that is not
self-evident. 

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>
        
Before leaving the lab, you should give the TA:
<ul>
    <li> a printout of your program, 
    <li> a printout of the interaction between you and the computer 
         when the program is run (see note on Testing above).
    <li> and you should mail a copy of your webpage program to 
         the class account (coen006) with the subject: "lab 9".
</ul>

If you finish the lab early, you should use the rest of the 
time to start the homework.
