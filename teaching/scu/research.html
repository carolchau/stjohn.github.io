<h1> Research Page of Katherine St. John </h1>

My research interests lie in random structures and algorithms,
languages, logic, and database theory.
Most recently, I have been working the expressibility of formal 
languanges over random structures, such as bit strings and
trees.

<p>
I am co-organizing a minisymposium at the
annual meeting of <a href= "http://www.siam.org">SIAM</a> on random 
structures and logic.  Here's our 
<a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/dm98/ms2.htm">session</a>
if you're going to be in Toronto in July.
