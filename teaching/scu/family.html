<h1>Family and Friends</h1>

<a href="http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~cleary">Sean</a> has a site with great
teaching pages, as well as loads of images and an explanation of why he has
so many bicycles.  
<a href="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~mastjohn/">Muffin</a> also has a page, as does
<a href="http://www.lava.net/~cvmiller/">Craig</a>.  
We're still waiting on the rest of the family...
