<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading. Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from 
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's 
<a href="http://www.lehman.edu/academics/arts-humanities/documents/CUNYPolicyonAcademicIntegrity.pdf">Academic Integrity Policy</a>,
(available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). <br>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. 

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and lab.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must 
perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style.
You can miss up to 5 programming assignments without affecting your grade (if you turn in all the programming assignments, we will drop the lowest 5 scores).
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>

<p><b>Classwork & Quizzes:</b> At every class meeting, there will be an in-class quiz or group work based on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory 
exercises.  
<ul>
	<li> As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
	as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.  
	<li> All quizzes must be taken during class time, and <b>there are no make-up quizzes.</b>  Instead, we will drop up to three missed quizzes
	(if you take all quizzes, we will drop the lowest three scores).
	<li> The top 25 (out of 28 possible) quiz scores will count towards the quiz score in the final grade.  If you do better on the final examination than on the top 25 quizzes, we will replace up to 5 quizzes with your final exam grade.  
	<li> All computer-based quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell and R programming environment
	<li> The programming quizzes are on paper (echoing the style of the final exam and many programming job interviews).  For these, you may
	<b>not</b> use your notes, books, or computer. 
		</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  <!--You make take the final at
any time it is being offered, and a sign-up survey will be available in late April for you to choose your preferred time.-->  The times for the
final are posted on the college registrar's and class websites.

<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Sets: 30% </li>
      <li>Classwork: 35%       </li>
      <li>Final Exam: 35%       </li>      
    </ul>
  </li>

	<p> 
	You must take and pass the final to pass the course.

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Textbooks:</b> The following are required for the course:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/">Think Stats (2nd Edition)</a> by Allen B. Downey (free on-line textbook).
	<li> <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (Python 3)</a> by Miller et al. (free on-line textbook).  
	<li> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">An Introduction to R</a> by Venables, Smith, and the R Core Team (free on-line textbook).	
</ul>

An excellent reference is:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Experimenters-Design-Innovation-Discovery/dp/0471718130/ref=la_B001HCUTPQ_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1488629648&sr=1-1">Statistics for Experimenters:  Design, Innovation, and Discovery</a>, 2nd Edition, by Box, Hunter, and Hunter.
</ul>
Due to its cost (and that we will only cover about half of the material in this book), it is a suggested, but not required text.

<p>
<b>Technology:</b> This course uses the <b>Python</b> and <b>R</b> programming language available from 
<a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a> or via 
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>.  It
is available on the department computers in Gillet Hall and on most public computers in the library and the Computer Center.  We will be using Python 3.
There are many free on-line versions that you could use via a browser, such as <a href="http://pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere</a>.  R is available from the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R Project for Statistical Computing</a>.

<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.

<p>
<b>Tutoring:</b> Departmental tutoring is available in the Math Lab on the 2nd floor of Gillet Hall.

Reserve: Selected books have been placed on reserve in the library.-->

<p><b>Accommodating Disabilities:</b>  Lehman College is committed to providing access to all programs and curricula to all students.  Students with disabilities who may need classroom accommodations are encouraged to register with the Office of Student Disability Services.
