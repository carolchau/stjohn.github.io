<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R4.21, p 171. 
    	<li> CCJ: Exercise R5.4, p 222. 
       	<li> CCJ: Exercise R5.14, p 223. 
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R5.15, p 224. 
	<li> Your new employer asks you to write the exact program you 
		wrote for your last employer. Is this ethical? What
		extra circumstances would make this ethical (or not
		ethical)? Justify your arguments.  
	<li> Most agree that copying a
		term paper off the web is unethical, but that using an idea
		discussed with a friend is not. Who owns an idea? Where do
		you draw the line? Support your answer with examples.
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<p>
    <dt><b>P9.</b> Exercise P4.8, p 174.  Submit this as program 9
		using the electronic submission.  Please call the 
		file (and the class) Program9.  Also, include an
		html file called "Program9.html" which calls your
		applet.  <font color = "red">(Due 26 February)</font>

		<p>
		Note: your program should terminate if the user
		enters a negative radius.  

		<p>
		You need to consider the case where one circle is
		completely contained inside the other, but the circles
		do not intersect. For example, one such case to
		consider is:
		<br><img src="circles.jpg">


<p>
    <dt><b>P10.</b> Exercise P4.10, p 174.  Submit this as program 10
		using the electronic submission.  Please call the 
		file (and the class) Program10. <font color = "red">(Due 26 February)</font>


<p>
    <dt><b>P11.</b> Exercise P5.24, p 231.  Submit this as program 11 
		using the electronic submission.  Please call the 
		file (and the class) Program11.
		<font color = "red">(Due 5 March)</font>

		<p> Note: This program checks to see if
		<tt>t</tt> is a substring of <tt>s</tt>.  Ask the user, 
		<b>first</b> for the string <tt>s</tt> and then for the 
		string <tt>t</tt>.


<p>
    <dt><b>P12.</b> Program 12 will draw a series of triangles
    		that are nested inside of one another.  The 
		program starts by the user clicking on three
		non-collinear points that make the outer triangle.
		For example:
<p>
		<applet code="descendingTri.class"
			height=300
			width=300>
		</applet>

<p>
		The program then calls the recursive function 
		<tt>descend</tt> which takes 3 points as parameters:
		<pre>public void descend(Point p1, Point p2, Point p3)</pre>

		<p>
		The function <tt>descend</tt> checks if the distance between
		the first two points is less than 0.5.  In which case, it
		stops.  Otherwise, it draws a triangle connecting <tt>p1</tt>,
		<tt>p2</tt>, and <tt>p3</tt>,
		calculates the midpoints of the 
		three sides of the triangle, and calls <tt>descend</tt>
		again with the midpoints.  
		
		<p>
		The function <tt>descend</tt> calls two helper functions
		to calculate the midpoint of a line: 
		<pre>public Point midpoint(Point a, Point b)	</pre>
		and the distance between two points:
		<pre>public double distance(Point a, Point b)	</pre>

<p>
  		Submit this as program 12 
		using the electronic submission.  Please call the 
		file (and the class) Program12.  Also, include an
		html file called "Program12.html" which calls your
		applet.
