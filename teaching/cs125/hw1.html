<h1>Homework 1 for Computer Science 125</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Computer Science</h2>
<h2>Boise State University, Spring 1999</h2>

<hr>
<font color="red">This homework is due by 9pm, Tuesday,
	26 January 1999.</font>  See the directions below
	to electronically submit homework.

<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R1.13, p 36.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R1.15, p 36.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R1.16, p 36.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R1.18, p 36.
	<li> Ethics: Give an example of an ethical dilemma
		discussed in Chapter 1.  Who is involved in
		the dilemma?  Which part of the ACM code
		(see Appendix A) covers this dilemma?
</ul>

<h2>Submitting Programs</h2>

Programming exercises are submitted electronically.  Before
you start an exercise, you should do the following:
<ul>
    <li> Create a directory (or folder) for your homework.
    	For example, for program 1, type at the prompt:
	<br>
	<i>mkdir p1</i>
	<br>
	(This command creates a new directory called ``p1''.)
    <li> Use this directory when creating any files for the
    	exercise.  Again, for program 1, the easiest way to
	do this is to type:
	<br>
	<i>cd p1</i>
	<br>
	(This ``changes directories'' to p1.)
	To create the file for your program, you type:
	<br>
	<i>gvim Hello.java</i>
	<br>
	(or ``emacs'' if you prefer that to ``vi''.)
    <li> To return to your home or main directory, type:
    	<br>
	<i>cd</i>
	<br>
	You will want to do this after finishing one program
	but before starting the next one.

</ul>

After you have finished a program and tested it thoroughly,
you need to submit the program electronically.  To submit
a program, you do the following:
<ol>
    <li> Include the honesty pledge at the top of each program:
    <br>
    /* I, &lt insert you name here&gt, pledge that this program is<br>
       my own indepedent work and conforms to the academic<br>
       honor code.<br>
     */<br>

    <li> Include a comment with your name, your login, and a
    	short description of what your program does.

    <li> Change directories to the program you would like
    	to submit.  To check to see that you're in the 
	right place, use the commmand
	<br>
	<i>pwd</i>
	<br>
	The directory path returned should end in ``p1'' for
	Program 1.
    <li> Compile your program.  For example, to compile Hello.java,
    	you type:
	<br>
	<i>javac Hello.java</i>
	<br>
	If there are errors, you will need to edit your program,
	fix them, and compile again.
    <li> To run your program, type:
    	<br>
	<i>java Hello</i>
	<br>
	(The program should say ``Hello World!'' with the exact
	spacing given below.)
    <li> Type the submit command
    	<br>
	<i>submit stjohn cs125 1</i>
	<br>
	Since this command gets used for many different courses,
	you need to specify the instructor and course name before
	specifying which program number you are submitting.
	(``stjohn'' is the instructor of the course, ``cs125'' is
	the course name, and ``1'' stands for Program 1).
	<br>
	If all goes well, the submit command will say the program
	has been successfully submitted.  If it doesn't, something
	went wrong.  You should get help and submit the program
	again.
</ol>


<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<p>
<dt><b>P1.</b> Program the "Hello World" program described on 
	p 21 of CCJ.  Submit this as program 1,
	using the electronic submission described above.

<p>
<dt><b>P2.</b> CCJ: Exercise P1.5, p 38.  Submit this as program 2,
	using the electronic submission described above.
