Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the group work problem
P3.15 (making a piechart).

<ul>
    <li> First Stage: Put in steps of algorithm as comments.<br>
	Compile to make sure there's no typos. 
	<ul>
	    <li> <a href="PieChart1.java">the code</a>
	    <li> <a href="pie1.html">demo</a> (does nothing)
	</ul>
    <li> Second Stage: Declare variables and do the easy steps of getting the
 	input and drawing outer circle.<br>
	Add an extra line to make sure the numbers are being
	read in correctly (to be removed later).<br>
	Compile and make sure it works before going on.
	<ul>
	    <li> <a href="PieChart2.java">the code</a>
	    <li> <a href="pie2.html">demo</a> 
	</ul>
    <li> Third Stage: Calculate first angle.  Run test cases to make sure
 	calculation is correct.<br>
	Remove the line added to test if numbers were being
	read in.<br>
	Compile and make sure it works before going on.
	<ul>
	    <li> <a href="PieChart3.java">the code</a>
	    <li> <a href="pie3.html">demo</a> 
	</ul>
    <li> Fourth Stage: Calculate the rest of the angles, using the positive
	x-axis as base.  <br>
 	Compile and make sure it works before going on.
	<ul>
	    <li> <a href="PieChart4.java">the code</a>
	    <li> <a href="pie4.html">demo</a> 
	</ul>
    <li> Fifth Stage: Add constants for "magic numbers", in this
	case the radius of 5.  <br>
 	Compile and make sure it works before going on.
	<ul>
	    <li> <a href="PieChart5.java">the code</a>
	    <li> <a href="pie5.html">demo</a> 
	</ul>

</ul>
