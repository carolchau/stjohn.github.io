<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R8.4, p 361.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R8.9, p 361.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.1, p 413.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.2, p 413.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.3, p 413.
	<li> Ethics: Scenario 4, p 233-236.  Who is responsible for
		the construction accident?  If more than one party
		is responsible, rank them in order of responsiblity.
		Justify your answer.
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>
<ol>
	
<p>
    <dt><b>P18.</b> Modify the 
    	<a href="plain.html">OneColorDraw</a> applet to 
	allow the user to change colors that are drawn.
	Add at least 3 choices of colors and buttons for
	each choice.  For example, if you choose the
	colors red, blue, and black, you should have buttons
	that when pressed, change the color that is drawn
	to red, blue, or black, respectively.  Your applet
	should also have a clear button like OneColorDraw.
	For example:
<p>
	<applet code="ThreeColorDraw.class"
		width = 300 height = 300>
	</applet>
<p>
    	Submit this as program 18 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program18.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program18.html
	that displays your applet.

<p>
    <dt><b>P19.</b> Write a class called <tt>PuzzlePiece</tt>.
    	A puzzle piece will have a label which will be a number
	between 1 and 15 and the location of the puzzle piece (which
	will be the coordinates of the upper left corner).  
	Your class should contain three 
	constructors: 
	<ul>
		<li> a default constructor that sets the 
		coordinates to (0,0) and the label to 0, 
		<li> a constructor that has a single argument
		that is assigned to label and sets the 
		coordinates to (0,0), and
		<li> a constructor that takes three arguments:
		the label, the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate
		(in that order) and sets the values.
	</ul>
	<p>
    	<tt>PuzzlePiece</tt> should contain a move method:
	<pre>    public void move(int dx, int dy)</pre>
	that changes the position by <tt>dx</tt> units in the x 
	direction and <tt>dy</tt> units in the y direction.
	Finally, you should have a draw method:
	<pre>    public void draw()</pre>
	that draws a square containing the label, using
	the object's coordinates for the upper left corner.
	<p>
	Write a second class called Program19 that uses 
	<tt>PuzzlePiece</tt> and demonstrates its features.
    	Submit this as program 19 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program19.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program19.html
	that displays your applet.

<p>
    <dt><b>P20.</b> P6.18, p 287.  Submit this as program 20
        using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program20.  Your program should
	calculate the result to six digits after the decimal
	point.
