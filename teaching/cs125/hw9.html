        <li> Ethics: Chapter 6:  Who has laws that better
                protect a person's privacy: United Kingdom or
                United States? <br>
                What information can be kept about a person?
                Who has access to it (under current US or UK
                law)?  What does it take to change incorrect
                information kept about you in a database?<br>
                Who is the NSA?  What do they have to do with
                privacy and encryption?<br>

</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<font color="red">
    You must comment your code (see book for examples).<br>
    You must include comments for all functions, following the
    <tt>javadoc</tt> format.  See CCJ, p 183-185 for more details.

    <dt><b>P26.</b> (Appointments) 
	 Write a class to store appointments.  Your
        <tt>Appointment</tt> class should store the beginning
        and ending time of the appointment, and a short
        description of the appointment (stored as a string).
        The <tt>Appointment</tt> class should also contain the
        following constructors:
        <ul>
            <li> the default constructor that sets the beginning
                and ending time to noon and the description to
                the empty string,
            <li> a constructor that takes a string for the
                description and sets the time to the current
                time,
            <li> a constructor whose first argument is a string
                for the description and second and third arguments
                are of type <tt>Time</tt> and store the beginning
                and ending time, respectively, of the appointment.
        </ul>
        and the following accessor and mutator methods:
        <ul>
            <li> <tt>public String toString()</tt>
            <li> <tt>public void setDescription(String s)</tt>
            <li> <tt>public String getDescription()</tt>
            <li> <tt>public void setBeginningTime(Time t)</tt>
            <li> <tt>public Time getBeginningTime()</tt>
            <li> <tt>public void setEndingTime(Time t)</tt>
            <li> <tt>public Time getEndingTime()</tt>
        </ul>

        Write a program that demonstrates that your class works.
        Have your program ask the user for an appointment, store
        this in an <tt>Appointment</tt> object, and then print
        out the appointment.  

	<p>
	<font color="blue">
	Your program should:
	<ol>
	    <li> Ask the user for the beginning time of the appointment.
	    	The time will be entered as 6 integers representing the
		year, the month, the day, the hour, the minute, and the
		second of the beginning time.
	    <li> Ask the user for the ending time of the appointment.
	    	The time will be entered as 6 integers representing the
		year, the month, the day, the hour, the minute, and the
		second of the ending time.
	    <li> Ask the user for a short description of the appointment.
	    	Note that this could consist of several words, so, you 
		should read the entire line, instead of a single word.
	</ol>
	</font>
	
	<p>
	You should include
        comments for each of your functions that can be used by
        <b>javadoc</b> to generate documentation (see notes from
        class or Appendix A for more details about using
        <b>javadoc</b>).
        This class will be used later for a daily planner
        program-- which will use the above methods. 
        The current program should be console-based.
        <p>
        Submit this as program 26
        using the electronic submission.  Please call the
        file (and the class) Program26.

<p>
<font color="red">Program 27 is cancelled, due to system difficulties!</font>
    <dt><b>P27.</b> (Animation)
        Modify <a href="animate.java">animate.java</a> to
        allow the user to control the length of time the
        images are seen on the screen.  You should have a
        choice button with the choices: "fast", "medium",
        and "slow."
        Include start and stop buttons that will start and
        stop your animation. For example:
        <br>
        <applet code="animate2.class"
                height=350
                width=475
                alt="Your browser isn't Java-enabled">
            <param name="basename" value="../../images/flyingM/flyingM">
            <param name="num_images" value="8">
        </applet>

        <p>
        Submit this as program 27
        using the electronic submission.  Please call the
        file (and the class) Program27.
        Include an HTML file in the directory called Program27.html
        that displays your applet and any images your applet
        uses.


<p>
    <dt><b>P28.</b> (Puzzle) 
     	Write a class called <tt>PuzzleBoard</tt>.
        <tt>PuzzleBoard</tt> should store 15 <tt>PuzzlePieces</tt>
        (see <a href="hw7.html">Homework 7, P19</a>) and include the
        following methods:
        <ul>
            <li> a default constructor that initializes the 15
                pieces as in the demonstration below.
            <li> a method that draws the puzzle pieces and the
                "Scramble" box.
            <li> a move method that takes a point as its input.
                If the point is contained in the "Scramble" box,
                it calls a second (private) method with a randomly
                chosen position 1000 times.  The purpose is to
                scramble the pieces, so the puzzle can be played.
        </ul>
        Your class should use the <tt>PuzzlePiece</tt> class written
        for P19.
        <p> <tt>PuzzleBoard</tt> will be called by
        <a href="puzzle/Program28.java">Program28.java</a>.
