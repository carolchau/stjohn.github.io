		the engineers have done differently?
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<font color="red">
    You must comment your code (see book for examples).<br>
    You must include comments for all functions, following the
    <tt>javadoc</tt> format.  See CCJ, p 183-185 for more details.

<p>
    <dt><b>P23.</b> (NPR Puzzle) Write a program that takes the name
        of a word file and a desired score.  These input parameters 
	can be given at the command line:
	<pre> > java Program23 wordFile 225 </pre>
	where the first argument is the name of the file and the 
	second is the desired score.  If the user does not provide
	arguments when calling the program, that is, they invoke the
	program with the command:
	<pre> > java Program23 </pre>
	prompt the user for the the name of the file, then for the
	desired score.

	<p>	
    	The program then prints out
	all words with that score from that given file.
	To assign a score to word, first assign a number to each
	letter: 1 to A, 2 to B, 3 to C, etc.  Then, the score of
	the word is the product of the numbers assigned to the 
	letters.  For example, the score of <tt>cab</tt> is 
	3*1*2 = 6.  

	<p>
	For example, if the file <tt>wordy</tt> contains:

	<table BORDER WIDTH="50%" NOSAVE >
	<tr> <td> cab</td>
	<tr> <td> bat</td>
	<tr> <td> batty</td>
	<tr> <td> cat</td>
	<tr> <td> cats</td>
	<tr> <td> mat</td>
	<tr> <td> mate</td>
	<tr> <td> gate</td>
	<tr> <td> agate</td>
	</table>

	and the user types in the command:
	<pre> > java Program23 wordy 700 </pre>
	The program prints:
	<pre> The following words have a score of 700:
	gate
	agate </pre>

	<p>
	Submit this as program 23 using the electronic submission. 
	Please call the file (and the class) Program23.  

	<p>
	Hint:  To assign a number to each letter, use the method
	<tt>indexOf</tt> on the string "*ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
	For example,
	<pre>
	"*ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".indexOf("C")
	</pre>
	is 3.  See Section 11.6, p 468 for an example of using
	<tt>indexOf</tt>.

	(See <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wesun/puzzle.html">NPR's
	Weekend Edition</a> for a related puzzler (28 March 1999)).
	

<p>
    <dt><b>P24.</b> (GPA Calculator) In plain java, write a GPA calculator
    	that allows the user to enter the grade and the credit hour of
	their courses, and then calculates their GPA.  The calculator 
	should include a <tt>clear</tt> button that clears all previously
	entered scores, a choice button for the letter grade, a choice
	for the number of credit hours, and a <tt>submit</tt> button
	that records their entry, displays the current GPA, <b>and</b>
	resets the choice buttons.  For example:
	<br>
	<applet code="GPACalculator.class"
	        height = 300
		width = 300></applet>
	<p>
	Follow the <a href="GPACalculator.html">javadoc comments</a> 
	for this applet when setting up your program.

	<p>
	Submit this as program 24 using the electronic submission. 
	Please call the file (and the class) Program24.  Include
	an HTML file called Program24.html to display your applet.
	
	<p>
	Hints:  
	<ul>
		<li> See the <a href="plain.html">plain java web page</a>
		for some example programs that write to the screen.  
		<li> Remember to change the color to "clear" the screen
		and to write to the screen.
		<li> The method, <tt>Integer.parseInt()</tt> takes a
		string and returns the integer it represents.

	</ul>

<p>
    <dt><b>P25.</b> (Merge sort, using <tt>sortedMerge</tt>)
    	Write a program that: 
	<ol>
          <li> Asks the user for the number of integers in their list. 
	  <li> Reads in those elements. 
	  <li> Calls a function called sort that sorts the list. 
	  <li> Prints out the list of numbers. 
	</ol>
	The sort function should split the list of numbers into two 
	lists of about the same length, sort each of these lists, and 
	then merge the lists together, using mergedSorted 
	(P21 from <a href="hw7.html">Homework 7</a>). 

	Submit this as program 25 using the electronic submission. 
	Please call the file (and the class) Program25.
