<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R8.4, p 361.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R8.9, p 361.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.1, p 413.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.2, p 413.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.3, p 413.
	<li> Ethics: Scenario 4, p 233-236.  Who is responsible for
		the construction accident?  If more than one party
		is responsible, rank them in order of responsiblity.
		Justify your answer.
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<font color="red">
    You must comment your code (see book for examples).<br>
    You must include comments for all functions, following the
    <tt>javadoc</tt> format.  See CCJ, p 183-185 for more details.

<p>
    <dt><b>P19.</b> (PuzzlePiece) Write a class called <tt>PuzzlePiece</tt>.
    	A puzzle piece will have a label which will be a number
	between 1 and 15 and the location of the puzzle piece (which
	will be the coordinates of the upper left corner).  
	Your class should contain three 
	constructors: 
	<ul>
		<li> a default constructor that sets the 
		coordinates to (0,0) and the label to 0, 
		<li> a constructor that has a single argument
		that is assigned to label and sets the 
		coordinates to (0,0), and
		<li> a constructor that takes three arguments:
		the label, the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate
		(in that order) and sets the values.
	</ul>
	<p>
    	<tt>PuzzlePiece</tt> should contain a move method:
	<pre>    public void move(int dx, int dy)</pre>
	that changes the position by <tt>dx</tt> units in the x 
	direction and <tt>dy</tt> units in the y direction.
	Finally, you should have a draw method:
	<pre>    public void draw()</pre>
	that draws a square containing the label, using
	the object's coordinates for the upper left corner.
	<p>
	Write a second class called Program19 that uses 
	<tt>PuzzlePiece</tt> and demonstrates its features.
	Program19 should construct two PuzzlePieces (one 
	using the default constructor and one using the
	other constructor), it should draw the puzzle pieces,
	and it should move at least one of the pieces.
	
	<p>
    	Submit this as program 19 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program19.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program19.html
	that displays your applet.

<p>
    <dt><b>P20.</b> (Connect-the-Dots) Write a applet in 
    	<tt>plain java</tt> that draws a dot when the user clicks
	the mouse and connects that dot to the previous one.
	Your applet should have a clear button that clears what
	has been drawn.  For example: 
<p>
	<applet code="Connect.class"
		width = 300 height = 300
		alt="(Your browser is not java-enabled.)">
	</applet>
<p>
	Hints:
	<ul>
	    <li> Modify OneColorDraw.java from <a href="plain.html">plain
	    	java notes</a>.
	    <li> There are two different cases for drawing.
		The first is when there is no previous point to connect
		the new point (this occurs when the applet first starts
		and after the
		clear button has been clicked).  The second case is when
		you do have a previous point and you draw a line between
		the two points.
	    <li> You can draw a "dot" by drawing a "filled rectangle"
	    	of small width and height.
	</ul>
    	Submit this as program 20 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program20.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program20.html
	that displays your applet.

<p>
    <dt><b>P21.</b> (Sorted Merge) P9.6, p 416.  Your program
    	should (in the following order):
	<ol>
	    <li> Ask for the length of the first sorted list of integers.
	    <li> Read in the first list of integers.
	    <li> Ask for the length of the second sorted list of integers.
	    <li> Read in the second list of integers.
	</ol>
	You may assume that the lists are sorted, and you do not
	have to error check for this.
	Your program should then print out the sorted list of
	numbers.  
    	Submit this as program 21 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program21.  

<p>
    <dt><b>P22.</b> (Permutations) P9.13, p 418.
    	Submit this as program 22 using the electronic submission.
	Please call the file (and the class) Program22.
