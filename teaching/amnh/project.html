<h2>Project<br>

</h2>
</div>

<div>

<p>
Today's lab begins with a quick tutorial on using Python, the built-in turtle and random libraries, and the on-line bioinformatics challenges, <a href="http://rosalind.info">Rosalind</a>.  The main focus is on simulating Brownian motion by
1D and 2D random walks.
<br>Software tools needed:  Python IDLE programming 
environment and a web browser (for accessing lab and <a href="http://rosalind.info">Rosalind</a>).




</div>



<div>
<h3>Using Python</h3>




<p>We will be using the IDLE programming environment for Python. The Python programming language and IDLE environment are freely available
for many platforms from <a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a>.  
For this class, we are using <b>Python 2</b>, which is part of the Mac OSX operating system.  Many features of the language
(including the syntax of <tt>print</tt> statements) changed between the second and third version, and many popular packages are still only available for the second version.

<p>
To launch IDLE on your Macintosh:
<ol>
	<li>  Open the <tt>Applications</tt> folder.  
	<li>  Inside it, open the <tt>Utilities</tt> folder.
	<li>  Launch the <tt>Terminal</tt> application.
	<li>  The terminal will open a window where you can type commands.  In that window, type:
	<blockquote><tt>idle</tt></blockquote>
	(remember to hit the <tt>enter/return</tt> key, so, the computer realizes you're done typing).
	<li>  Another window should open.  Test to see if it is working by typing:
	<blockquote><tt>print "Hello!"</tt></blockquote>
	(remember to hit the <tt>enter/return</tt> key, so, the computer realizes you're done typing).
</ol>

<p>
Once you have IDLE running, you can keep it in your dock by clicking on it and choosing options.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Turtle Library & <tt>for</tt> loops</h3>

<p>
For our first programs, we will use a built-in library (file of useful commands) for drawing using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html">turtles</a>. We will begin with a simple program and modify it to add functionality.  This can be done from the Python prompt (<tt> >>> </tt> in IDLE), but it is easier to store the program in a file and modify the file. To do this, go to the <tt>File</tt> menu of <tt>IDLE</tt> and choose <tt>New File</tt> (or type <tt>&#8984;N</tt>).</p>

<p>In the new file window, type:
<pre>
    import turtle

    teddy = turtle.Turtle()
    for i in range(4):
        teddy.forward(100)
        teddy.right(90)
    
    turtle.exitonclick()
</pre>
Indentation does matter, so, remember to indent the lines after the <tt>for</tt>, using TABs, 
so that they are included in the <tt>for</tt>-loop.
Save the file as <tt>firstProgram.py</tt>.  

<p>Notes on saving files: 
<ul>  
	<li> You can save your programs as almost anything, except the names of libraries (e.g. <tt>turtle</tt> or <tt>random</tt>).  Using a library name will confuse Python-- it will think your program should be used instead of the similarly named library.  
	<li> Saving your program with the <tt>.py</tt> extension is not necessary, but it is good form.  Also, any file with a <tt>.py</tt> extension will be displayed nicely (color coding of keywords, etc.)
</ul>
	
To run your program, go to the <tt>Run</tt> menu and choose <tt>Run Module</tt>.  Python should open a new graphics window and draw a square.  

<h4>Line-by-Line</h4>
<p>
What is this program doing?  Let's go through, line-by-line:
<ul>
	<li> The first line
	<pre>
    import turtle</pre>
    tells Python that you would like to use some of the commands contained in the module, called, <tt>turtle</tt>.
	<li> The next line creates a <tt>turtle</tt> object that can be used in the program:
	<pre>
    teddy = turtle.Turtle()</pre>
	I named my turtle after President Roosevelt, but you can use any name you would like (as long as you spell it the same throughout).
	
	<li> A <tt>for</tt> statement is used to repeatedly perform sequences of statements (so called a ``loop'').  This <tt>for</tt>-loop repeats actions
	4 times:
	<pre>
    for i in range(4):</pre>
  	To repeat the actions more times, you can change the parameter to the <tt>range</tt> statement.  For example, <tt>range(6)</tt> in our loop would repeat the actions 6 times.
	<li> Inside our <tt>for</tt>-loop, we have our turtle perform 2 actions:  walk forward 100 steps, and then turn 90 degrees:
	<pre>
        teddy.forward(100)
        teddy.right(90)</pre>  	
	<li> The last command keeps the graphics window open until the mouse is clicked.  When clicked, the window will close and the program will end.
	<pre>
    turtle.exitonclick()</pre>
</ul>


<h4>Some Challenges</h4>

Modify your program to:
<ol>
	<li> Draw a hexagon.
	<li> Draw an octagon.
	<li> What does the following do?  Work through it on paper, and then implement in Python to verify:
	<pre>
    import turtle

    teddy = turtle.Turtle()
    for i in range(40):
        teddy.forward(10*i)
        teddy.right(90)
    
    turtle.exitonclick()
</pre>
	<li> Implement the following piece of pseudocode (i.e. directions that look very similar to code) as a complete program using turtle graphics:
	<pre>
    Repeat 45 times:
        Walk forward 100 steps
        Turn right 92 degrees
    </pre>
    <p>
	Your output should look similar to: <br>
	<img src="spiral.jpg">
	<li>  Draw a 5-pointed star.
	<li>  Print your name to the Python prompt 50 times.
<p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Random Library</h3>

<p>Another useful library is <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html">random</a> library that generates (pseudo)-random numbers.  The following:
<pre>
	import random           #use the random library
		
	# other code here....
		
	random.randrange(7)
</pre>
generates a random whole number between 0 and 6.  Similarly, the 
command
<pre>
	random.randrange(360)
</pre>
generates a random whole number between 0 and 359.  The command also allows random numbers to be chosen from multiples.  For example:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(0,100,2)</tt> chooses a random even number that's
	greater than 0 and less than 100.
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(0,360,90)</tt> chooses a random number from the
	sequence <tt>0, 90, 180, 270</tt>.
	
</ul>

Let's write a program that turns a random amount each time.  Here is an outline in comments (anything after the `#' is ignored by Python):
<pre>
#Include the random and turtle libraries
#Create a turtle
#Have a loop that repeats 25 times
	#Inside that loop, 
	#Move forward 10 steps
	#Turn a random amount
#Close window on mouse click
</pre>
Try to fill in each piece (if you're stuck, <a href="randomTurn.py">here</a> is a possible solution).

<h4>Some Challenges</h4>

Modify your program to:
<ol>
	<li> Modify your random turning program to make random turns of 90 degrees only (i.e. 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees only).
 	<li> Modify your random turning program to make random turns of 180 degrees only (i.e. 0 and 180 degrees only).	
</ol>

<h3>Simulating Brownian Motion with Random Walks</h3>

<p>
We can use the programs above to simulate `random walks' where an object moves in a random direction (and a random distance forward).  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">Random walks</a> are well studied for modeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>, diffusion models, paths of foraging animals, fluctuations in stock prices, and genetic drift.   

<p>
For this lab, we will use the random turn programs to gather data to affirm or refute the hypothesis:
<blockquote>
	The longer the walk, on average, the farther east or west from the origin it ends.
</blockquote>

<p>
Some notes:
<ul>
	<li> Test this hypothesis for all three types of random turns: 1 degree, 90 degrees, and 180 degree turns.
	<li> The turtle library has several commands for reporting position.  A useful one here is <tt>xcor()</tt> which gives the x coordinate of the turtle.
	<li> For each length = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, simulate 10 runs and report the average of the <tt>x</tt> position for each length walk. 
</ul>
