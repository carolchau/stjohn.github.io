<h3>Solving Differential Equations</h3>

<p>The <tt>numpy</tt> module has the capability to integrate difficult functions.  The standard scientific example used is modeling predator-prey populations, such as the snowshoe hare and Canadian Lynx which the Hudson Bay Company kept careful records over the last 300 years.

To model the interplay between the populations, we will use equations of Lokta and Volterra, who gave the change in population of prey (u) and predators (v) as:
<ul>
	<li> Prey population grows proportional to the number of prey but decreases at a rate proportional to uv:
		<p>
		<sup><i>du</i>/</sup><sub><i>dt</i></sub> = Au - Buv 
		</p>
	<li> Predator population decreases proportional to the number of predators but grows at a rate proportional to uv:
		<p>
		<sup><i>dv</i>/</sup><sub><i>dt</i></sub> = -Cv + Duv 
		</p>	
</ul>
where A, B, C, and D are constants.
