<div>
<h3>Downloading packages</h3>

<p>
We will be using some packages that are not part of the default Python installation.  To check if your Python has them, type the following at the Python shell:
<pre>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
</pre>

<p>
If there are no errors, then you already have these packages.  If not, you will need them.  The easiest way is to get the popular packages for scientific computing is to download <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">anaconda</a> distribution of Python.  It will install a second copy of Python on your computer (you can still use the old).  You can also install <a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>
and <a href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a> separately.

<p>
<a href="">basemap</a> is an extra package for drawing geographic maps.  It is not part of many installations and needs to be added.  In the anaconda Python, if you type:
<pre>
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
</pre>
it will give you the exact command to download basemap.  You can also download 
<a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html">basemap</a> directly:
<pre>
conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/anaconda basemap
</pre>

<p>
The downloads will take about 15-30 minutes, depending on the internet speed.  You might want to start the downloads and go on to the next part of the lab (which does not depend on either).

</div>

<div>
<h3>CSV Files</h3>

<p>
While you are waiting for <tt>matplotlib</tt> to download, let's get some data to use for our mapping.

<p>
Many programs will export data in Comma-Separated-Values (CSV) format.  This includes almost all of the specimen databases at the museum.  We will focus on the <a href="http://sci-web-001.amnh.org/db/emuwebamnh/index.php">Vertebrate Zoology databases</a> since some (Ichthyology & Ornithology) include location information for many of their specimens and allow direct downloads from their webpages.  

<p>For today's lab, you will need a CSV file with at least 10 specimens for which location data has been stored (the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE columns).  With that caveat in mind, choose specimens that would be useful for your thesis or interest you.  
<ol>
	<li> Go to <a href="http://sci-web-001.amnh.org/db/emuwebamnh/index.php">Vertebrate Zoology databases</a>.
	<li> Choose Ichthyology or Ornithology (unfortunately, the others do not have latitude and longitude data).
	<li> Type in your favorite genus or country, and click the <tt>Submit</tt>
	button.
	<li> The first 25 records will be displayed.  Click the <tt>Export up to 2000 Records</tt> button at the bottom of the screen.
	<li> A file titled, <tt>AMNH-Ornithology-Internet-Export.csv</tt> or 
	<tt>AMNH-Ichthyology-Internet-Export.csv</tt> will be downloaded.
</ol>

<p>
CSV files store tabular information in readable text files.  The files downloaded above have information separated by commas (using tabs as delimiters is also common).  Here is a sample line:
<pre>
"DOT 84 FLUID 11383",Ceyx lepidus collectoris,Solomon Islands,New Georgia Group,Vella Lavella Island,Oula River camp,,,,07 47 30 S,156 37 30 E,Paul R. Sweet,7-May-04,,PRS-2672,,,"Tissue Fluid "
</pre>
<p>
All lines are formatted similarly: they start with the catalog number, then idenfication of the specimen, followed by location information, when and who collected it, and sometimes other fields describing the specimen (e.g. sex, age, preparation)  The first line of the file gives the entries in the order they occur in the rows.  Here is the first line for ornithology records:
<pre>
CATALOG NUMBER,IDENTIFICATION,COUNTRY,STATE,COUNTY,PRECISE LOCALITY,OCEAN,ISLAND GROUP,ISLAND,LATITUDE,LONGITUDE,COLLECTOR(S),COLLECTING DATE FROM,COLLECTING DATE TO,COLLECTORS NUMBER,SEX,AGE,PREPS
</pre>

<p>
Python has a built-in module to manipulate CSV files.  The basic commands are:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>import csv</tt><br>
		Include at the the top of your file to use the <tt>csv</tt> module.
	<li> <tt>f = open("in.csv")</tt><br>
		Open the file normally (not a csv command, but needed by the next step).
	<li> <tt>reader = csv.DictReader(f)</tt><br>
		Creates a reader with the names in the first line used to access the data in each row.
	<li> <tt>for row in reader:</tt><br>
		Can then access the entries using a similar <tt>for</tt>-loop as used with other files.
	<li> <tt>if "Malaysia" in row['COUNTRY']:</tt><br>
		Can access entries in each row using the column name (instead of counting out the offset).
</ul>

Let's use these commands to print out all specimens with latitude and longitude stored in our file.  The pseudocode is:<br>
<ol>
	<li> Import CSV module.
	<li> Open the CSV file.
	<li> Create a CSV dictionary reader with your file.
	<li> For each row in the reader:
		<ol>
			<li>  If the row['LATITUDE'] entry is not the empty string,
			<li>  Then print out the identification, latitude, and longitude.
		</ol>
	<li> Close your file.
</ol>
Make a first pass at translating this into Python, and then look at 
<a href="filterEntries.py">one possible way</a> to do it.

<p>
We will use the coordinates for the next part of the lab, so, let's store them in a list:
<pre>
#Open the file:
f = open("AMNH-Ornithology-Internet-Export.csv", "rU")
#Using the dictionary reader to access by column names:
reader = csv.DictReader(f)

#Set up arrays to hold the information extracted from the csv file:
latStrings = []
longStrings = []
ident = []

#Traverse the file by rows, filtering for those specimens with GIS data:
for row in reader:
  if row['LATITUDE'] != '':
    ident.append(row['IDENTIFICATION'])
    latStrings.append(row['LATITUDE'])
    longStrings.append(row['LONGITUDE'])
f.close()

#Print out latStrings to make sure it is working:
print latStrings
</pre>

<h3><tt>matplotlib</tt> and <tt>basemap</tt></h3>

<p>Today, we will use one small part of the <tt>matplotlib</tt> library.  It is a very popular for presenting results in 2D plots to be used in papers and presentations.  We will plot GIS coordinates that we extracted from the database.  Over the next several weeks, we will use other features of <tt>matplotlib</tt> and the popular numerical analysis package <a href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a>.

<p>
The <tt>basemap</tt> package of <tt>matplotlib</tt> allows you to customize maps and then plot them using the standard <tt>matplotlib</tt> library.  Let's first draw some maps, using the build-in projections, and then add points to represent the GIS coordinates of the specimen information from the database.


<h4>Drawing Maps</h4>

<p>
The <tt>basemap</tt> package follows a familiar format:  it stores information in an object and provides functions for manipulating that object.  We have seen this before with the <tt>turtle</tt> objects or regular expression <tt>match</tt> objects.  For <tt>basemap</tt>, the objects are maps (from the <tt>Basemap</tt> class).  The <tt>Basemap</tt> functions include the ability to change projections, regions, borders, and colors. 

<p>To get started, let's draw a simple map of the world.  It takes a bit for it to run (you will get a warning telling you this):
<pre>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap

m = Basemap()
m.drawcoastlines()
plt.show()
</pre>
To continue, close the map window.

<p>
To make the map more interesting, let's add some color.  We can do this by using the <tt>fillcontinents()</tt> function: 
<pre>
m.fillcontinents(color='darkgreen',lake_color='darkblue')
</pre>
To also fill in the oceans:
<pre>
m.drawmapboundary(fill_color='darkblue')
</pre>
<p>(Feel free to alter the colors to make a more attractive map.)

<p>If you would like to use satelite data (NASA 'Blue Marble' imagery), there is a function, <tt>bluemarble()</tt>
<pre>
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
m = Basemap()
m.bluemarble()
plt.show()
</pre>
As well as an option to show the map with shaded relief (<tt>shadedrelief()</tt>)
and etopo relief (<tt>etopo()</tt>).  Try these various `backgrounds'
(see <a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/geography.html">map background</a> for more options).

<h4>Changing Projections and Regions</h4>
<p>
There are also options to change the region of the map displayed as well as the projection.  The function that constructs the map object has many, many options that control the region projected, the type of projection, and the resolution of coastlines and other features.  

<p>
For example, 
<pre>
map = Basemap(projection='ortho',lat_0=45,lon_0=-100,resolution='l')
</pre>
sets up an orthographic map projection with perspective of satellite looking down at 50N, 100W.  It uses low resolution coastlines.

<p>
Some common projections and useful parameters:
<ul>
	<li> Orthographic:  displays the earth as a satellite (in an orbit infinitely high above the earth) would see it.<br>
	Example:  <tt>map = Basemap(projection='ortho',lat_0=45,lon_0=-100)</tt>
	<br>(where <tt>lat_0</tt> and <tt>lon_0</tt> are the coordinates above which the satellite would be).
	<li> Mercator:  a cylindrical, conformal projection. Very large distortion at high latitudes, cannot fully reach the polar regions.<br>
	Example:  <tt>m = Basemap(projection='merc',llcrnrlat=-80,urcrnrlat=80,\
            llcrnrlon=-180,urcrnrlon=180,lat_ts=20,resolution='c')</tt>
    <br> (where <tt>llcrnrlat,llcrnrlon,urcrnrlat,urcrnrlon</tt> are the lat/lon values of the lower left and upper right corners of the map.
	<tt>lat_ts</tt> is the latitude of true scale.
	<tt>resolution = 'c'</tt> means use crude resolution coastlines.)
</ul>
See <a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/mapsetup.html">projections</a> for many, many more.

<p>Some useful things to add to your map:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>coastlines()</tt>
	<li> <tt>drawparallels(np.arange(-90.,120.,30.))</tt>
	<li> <tt>drawmeridians(np.arange(0.,360.,60.))</tt>
</ul>

<h4>Plotting Points</h4>

<p>
The goal of this lab is to plot the location data from the CSV file to a map.  
We'll first plot a single point, the location of New York City, and then move on to the specimen data.

<p>The coordinates for New York City are:  40.7127 N, 74.0059 W.  To use for this package, we use the following conversion:
<ul>
	<li> Longitudes are the <tt>y-coordinates</tt>.
	<li> Latitudes are the <tt>x-coordinates</tt>.	
	<li> <tt>N</tt> is a positive number (above the equator).
	<li> <tt>S</tt> is a negative number (below the equator).
	<li> <tt>E</tt> is a positive number (to the right of the prime meridian).
	<li> <tt>W</tt> is a negative number (to the left of the prime meridian).
</ul>
So, 40.7127 N, 74.0059 W becomes <tt>(-74,40.7)</tt>.  To plot it to our map, we first convert it to the map's coordinates, and then plot it:
<pre>
x,y = m(-74,40)
m.plot(x,y,'ro',markersize=10)
</pre>
The <tt>'ro'</tt> is a <tt>matplotlib</tt> option to plot red circles and <tt>markersize</tt> controls how large the plotted point appears.

<h4>Plotting Lists of Points</h4>

The program, <a href="mapEntries.py">mapEntries.py</a>, takes the locations of specimens that we extracted from the csv file and plots them on a map.  The steps to do this are:
<ul>
	<li> For each strings that has a latitude or a longitude, convert it into a number (making it positive or negative depending on E,W,N,S).
	<li> Take each numeric latitude and longitude and find out its x and y coordinates for our map (each projection gives different coordinates):
	<pre>
		x, y = m(longs[i],lats[i])
	</pre>
	(remember that longitudes correspond to x-values and latitudes to y-values.)
	<li> Plot each point to the map:
		<pre>
		m.plot(x,y,'ro',markersize=10)
	</pre>
	<li> Then, diplay (show) the plot.
</ul>
Try the program above on your data file.  Make the following modifications:
<ul>
	<li> Zoom in on your region.  For example, if all of your data is in Mexico, display only that part of the world.
	<li> Display with different background. 
</ul>
