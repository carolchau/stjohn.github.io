<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today, we focus on inheritance.
</p>

<div>
<h3>Cross</h3>

<p>Derive a new class, <tt>Cross</tt>, from the <tt>BoundedShape</tt> class
from Chapter 9 (available in Blackboard).  Your class should draw a cross
(i.e. an "X") inside the bounding box.  Demonstrate your new class with a
program that draws several crosses.
</p>

<h3>Monetary Coin</h3>

<p>PP 9.2 (p 203): Create a class called <tt>MonetaryCoin</tt> that is 
derived from the <tt>Coin</tt> class presented in Chapter 6
(available on Blackboard).  Store a value in the monetary coin that
represents its value and add a method that returns its value.  Create
a driver class whose <tt>main</tt> method instantiates several 
<tt>MonetaryCoin</tt> objects and computes their total value.  
Demonstrate that the monetary coin inherits its parent's ability to
be flipped.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
