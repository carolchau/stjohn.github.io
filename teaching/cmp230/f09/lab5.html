<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today's lab is an introduction to loops and repetition.
</p>

<h3>Repetition</h3>
<p>
For today's lab, we will do a series of short programs involving
while and loop statements:
</p>


<h4>Hopping Forever</h4>

<p>
Using your kangaroo from <a href="lab2.html">Lab 3</a>, create a 
world where your kangaroo hops forever.<br>
Hint:  Use a <tt>While true</tt> statement.
</p>

<h4>Stop Hop</h4>

<p>
Using your kangaroo world from above, add in a tree and have 
your kangaroo hop towards tree as long as the distance is greater
than 3 meters.<br>
Hint:  Use the <tt>distance behind</tt> proximity function (see Appendix B).
</p>


<h4>Falling Object</h4>

<p>
Ex 3.5 (p 63):  Write a <tt>While</tt> statement that causes an 
object of your choice (some possible ones: a ball, a skydiver, a water balloon, 
a meteor, etc.) to move down one meter as long as it is above a specific
object on the ground (e.g. a target, a person, a house, etc.).<br>
Hint:  Use the <tt>is above</tt> proximity function (see Appendix B).
</p>



<h4>Ten Twirls</h4>

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Bunny2.png">
<p>
Ex 3.9:  Write a loop statement that causes an object (e.g. a skater,
a bunny, a car, etc) to spin in place 10 times.
</p>

<h4>Count Down</h4>



<p>
Ex 3.8:  Write a <tt>While</tt> statement updates the value of a
variable called <tt>seconds</tt> and displays it in a 3D text
object called <tt>countdown</tt>.  Start <tt>seconds</tt> at 10 and 
loop until it reaches 0.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
