For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today's lab is the first on using arrays in Java.
</p>
</div>




<div>

<h3>Letter and Number Counts</h3>

<p>Modify the <tt>LetterCount</tt> program so that it also counts
the digits 0-9 and reports the results.
</p>

<h3>Rocket Drawing</h3>

<p>Modify the <tt>Rocket</tt> program so that there is another 
rocket, also drawn using arrays and polylines.
</p>

<h3>Number Counts</h3>

<p>
PP 8.4 (p 174):  Create a program that reads an arbitrary number
of integers that are in the range 0 to 50, inclusive, and counts
how many occurrences of each are entered.  After all input has
been processed, print all of the values that were entered one
or more times with the number of occurrences of each.
</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
