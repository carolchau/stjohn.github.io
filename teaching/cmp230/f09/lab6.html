<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today's lab focuses on more complicated worlds with loops and repetition.

<h3>Biplane</h3>

<p>
PP 3.2 (p 64): Create an Alice world in which a <tt>Biplane</tt> from the <tt>Vehicles</tt>
gallery flies in from the right side of the viewing area, makes seven 
consecutive veritcal loops as it moves across the sky, then flies off to
the left.  Its propeller should be turning the entire time.
</p>


<h3>Frog Race</h3>

<p>
PP 3.5:  Create an Alice world in which two frogs race toward
a finish line.  Use a loop in which both frogs hop forward in each 
iteration.  Determine the distance of each hop randomly.  End the
animation when one of the frogs crosses the finish line.  The <tt>Frog</tt>
class is in the <tt>Animals</tt> gallery.  
</p>


<h3>Bouncing Ball</h3>

<p>
PP 3.6:  Create an Alice world in which a ball rolls off a table,
bounces on the ground, and eventually comes to rest.  Use the 
<tt>ToyBall</tt> class from the <tt>Sports</tt> gallery to create
the ball.  Use a loop to control the bounces, 
decreasing the height of the rebound by half every time.  Move the
ball away from the table slightly on each bounce.  Continue the bounces until the 
rebound height decreases to an insignificant amount.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
