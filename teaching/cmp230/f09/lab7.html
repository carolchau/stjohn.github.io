<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today's lab is an introduction to event handling.  We will start with simple
event processing for world and keyboard events.  Next lab will continue with 
mouse and condition events.

<h3>Event Tutorial</h3>

<p>Start today's lab by working through the penguin chorus (event)
tutorial.</p>


<h3>Motorboat Race</h3>

<p>
PP 4.7:  Create an Alice world in which a motorboat is controlled using
three arrow keys: the up arrow moves the boat forward and the right and 
left arrows turns the boat.  Set up a series of obstacles and gates to 
demonstrate the maneuverability of your boat.<br>
Note:  The second part of the exercice in the book (tracking the time it 
takes the boat to reach a finish line and displaying it as a stop watch
on the screen), we will do as part of the next lab.
</p>



<h3>Helicopter Simulator</h3>

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Helicopter.png">

<p>
PP 4.5 (p 84): Create an Alice world in which a <tt>Helicopter</tt> from the 
<tt>Vehicles</tt> hovers , blades constantly turning.  Allow the user to:</p>
<ul>
	<li> move the helicopter up and down using the up and down arrow keys,</li>
	<li> turn the helicopter right or left using the right and left arrow keys, and</li>
	<li> move forward using the space bar</li>
</ul>
<p>
Build an interesting world to fly around to make it obvious the helicopter
is moving.
</p>

<h3>Kangaroo</h3>

<p>
Using the kangaroo (with the <tt>hop</tt> method with parameters from 
<a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>), create a new world where the user 
controls how far the kangaroo jumps.  When the user clicks on a number
between 1 and 9, the kangaroo jumps forward that many meters.  For 
example, if the user clicks on the '6' key, the kangaroo jumps forward
6 meters.
</p>

<h3>Horse</h3>

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Horse.png">

<p>
Create an Alice world in which a horse is relaxing in a field.  Use
the <tt>Horse</tt> class in the <tt>Animals</tt> gallery.  Define four
different basic actions for the horse (sway its tail, dip its head, 
whinny, etc.)  When the user clicks any key, have the horse perform
one of the four actions, at random.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
