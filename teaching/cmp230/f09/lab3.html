<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today's lab, we will work more with methods, focusing on parameters.

<h3>Using Parameters</h3>

<p>
Modify your world with a kangaroo from <a href="lab2.html">last lab</a>
so that the <tt>hop</tt> method accepts a parameter that specifies
the jumping distance.  Demonstrate your new method by having the kangaroo
hop several times.

<p>
Programming Project 2.3 (p 38): Create an Alice world that shows a 
search and rescue opertation in which a helicopter flies in a pattern 
above the ocean, occasionaly stopping to hover for a while as if looking 
for something.  Eventually the helicopter swoops in to save a person who 
was adrift.  Create a <tt>hover</tt> method the helicopter that accepts
the number of seconds it should hover as a parameter.  Create a 
<tt>search</tt> method and a <tt>rescue</tt> method to handle those
aspects of the operation.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
