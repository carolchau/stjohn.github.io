<p>
Create a world with at least ten objects arranged like dominoes
(for example, you could use the <tt>Box</tt> class from the <tt>Shapes</tt>
gallery.  These items should all be in a list.  When the user clicks
anything in the world, the first item should fall over and strike the
second item, which should fall over and strike the third item, and
so on.  (Hint:  Use the <tt>For all in order</tt> statement.)
</p>

<h3>Airport</h3>


<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Boeing707.png">

<p>
Create a world that simulates an airport with a control tower and
a runway.  A group of airplanes should be lined up, ready for 
take-off.  Store the airplane objects in a list.  One at a time, the 
airplanes should take off and fly away into the distance.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
