<h2>Lab 16</h2>
<h3>CMP 230: Programming Methods I <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>

<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today's lab is the first on using lists (called <tt>ArrayLists</tt> in Java).
</p>
</div>




<div>

<h3>Colored Dots</h3>

<p>Modify the <tt>Dots</tt> program so that the first dot created is
drawn in yellow, the newest dot is drawn in red, and all other dots are
drawn in green.
</p>

<h3>Disappearing Dots</h3>

<p>Modify the <tt>Dots</tt> program so that after 10 dots have been 
created, the oldest one disappears whenever a new one is created.
</p>

<h3>Polyline</h3>

<p>
PP 8.9 (p 175):  Create a program that allows the user to make 
a polyline shape dynamically using mouse clicks.  Each mouse 
click adds a new line segment from the previous point to the
location of the mouse click.  Include a button below the 
drawing area to clear the current polyline and begin another.</p>

<p>
Hint:  start with the <tt>Dots</tt> program and have it draw
lines between a point and the previous one in the list.
</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
