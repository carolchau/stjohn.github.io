<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today's lab, we will work more with methods, data and expressions, and 
random numbers.
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Methods are used to define behaviors for an object.  For example, 
in lecture and in the text, we have used built-in methods such as 
<tt>roll</tt> and <tt>move</tt> and created methods to make objects
(i.e. cheerleaders and frogs) jump.
</p>

<p>
Create a new Alice world with a kangaroo (from the <tt>Animals</tt>
gallery).  Add a new method called <tt>hop</tt> that makes the 
kangaroo hop into the air and land again while moving forward a
short distance.  Demonstrate your new method by having the kangaroo
hop several times.

<p>
Programming Project 2.1 (p 37) asks you to create an Alice world in 
which a bird flies across the sky.  Use an appropriate class from the 
<tt>Animals</tt> gallery (i.e. the <tt>pterodactyl</tt> class) to make 
the bird fly.  Add a method called <tt>flap</tt> to the bird that causes
both wings to move up and down in unison one full stroke while move the 
bird forward a set distance.
</p>




<h3>Random Numbers</h3>

<p>
Programming Project 2.7 (p 38) asks that you create a world in which 
three beetles are seen scurrying around the ground.  Instead of beetles, 
create an object of your favorite animal (or bug) class.  Add a method
called <tt>scurry</tt> that causes the animal to turn in a random direction
and then move forward a random direction.  Duplicate that animal twice
and call the <tt>scurry</tt> method of all three objects several times 
from <tt>my first method</tt>.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
