<h3>ShapeMaker</h3>

<p>Add the <tt>Oval</tt> and the <tt>Circle</tt> classes to the 
<tt>ShapeMaker</tt> program (available on Blackboard) and modify 
the controls that allow them to be drawn.
</p>

<p>Next, add a button to the control panel in the <tt>ShapeMaker</tt>
program to clear the drawing surface.
</p>

<h3>Happy Face</h3>

<p>Make a new class, called <tt>HappyFace</tt> that extends the 
<tt>Oval</tt> (or <tt>Circle</tt>) class from Chapter 9 (available 
on Blackboard).  Your class should have methods that allow the user 
to draw a happy face on the screen.  To demonstrate your class,
add it to the <tt>ShapeMaker</tt> program and modify the controls
so that it also can be drawn.
</p>




<!--  Not sure I want to explain arrays of abstract classes...
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>

<p>Make a new class, called <tt>TicTacToe</tt> which contains
a 3 by 3 array of <tt>BoundedShape</tt>, i.e.:
<pre>
BoundedShape[] gameBoard = new Bounded
</pre>
Derive a new class, <tt>Cross</tt>, from the <tt>BoundedShape</tt> class
from Chapter 9 (available in Blackboard).  Your class should draw a cross
(i.e. an "X") inside the bounding box.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
