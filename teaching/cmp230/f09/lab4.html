<h3>Decisions</h3>
For today's lab, we will do a series of short programs involving
decision (If/Else) statements:

<h4>Too Hot</h4>

<p>
Create a world with a snowman and stove in it (found in the <tt>People</tt>
and <tt>Kitchen</tt> galleries, respectively).  In the <tt>my first method</tt>,	
add in an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement that the snowman jumps if he is within
2  meters of the stove.  He should do nothing otherwise.  Test your decision
statement by placing your snowman in different spots in the world.</p>


<h4>Shrinking Bunny</h4>

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Bunny2.png">
<p>
Create a world with a bunny in it.  In the <tt>my first method</tt>,	
add in an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement that 30% of the time the bunny
doubles in size and the rest of the time the bunny shrinks to half of
its original size.  Play the program several times to show the affect.</p>

<h3>Morning Dancing</h3>

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/PinkBallerina.png">
<p>
Create a world with a dancer in it (several are in the <tt>People</tt>
gallery).  Write an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement that causes the dancer
to spin in place two revolutions if it's currently morning.<br>
<i>(Hint: Use the <tt>Is AM</tt> world function (see Appendix
B of the book for more details)).</i>
</p>

<h4>Changing Colors</h4>

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/Snowman.png">
<p>
Create a world with a snowman and stove in it (found in the <tt>People</tt>
and <tt>Kitchen</tt> galleries, respectively).  In the <tt>my first method</tt>,	
add in an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement that the snowman turns red is within
2  meters of the stove, otherwise he turns blue.  You can control the color
of the snowman by using <tt>color</tt> from its list of properties.</p>



<h4>Random Roo</h4>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/kangaroo.png">

<p>
Create a world with a kangaroo under a tree.  Have the kangaroo move 
a random distance forward.  Next use an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement 
that causes the kangaroo to spin in place if he is farther than a 
meter from the tree.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
