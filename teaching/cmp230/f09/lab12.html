<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today, we continue with Java and Eclipse.  The focus is on using the control
structures for repetition and loops we learned about in Alice in Java.

<h3>Bullseye</h3>

<p>Modify the <tt>Bullseye</tt> program from the book (available from the
CD or on Blackboard) so that:
<ul>
	<li> the largest ring is white and the others alternatve accordingly, and</li>
	<li> there are approximately twice as many rings that are each half as thin.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Circles</h3>

<p>PP 6.1 (p 121): Using the <tt>Circles</tt> class from the book (available 
from the CD or on Blackboard), create a Java program that draws 100 circles
of random size, color, and location.  Ensue that in each case the entire
circle appears in the visible area of the panel.</p>

<h3>Star</h3>

<p>PP 6.6:  Create a class called <tt>Star</tt> that represents a five-pointed
star of a particular size and color.  Then write a program that creates 
and draws four stars of various sizes at different locations.
</p>


<h3>Stick Figures</h3>

<p>Using the <tt>StickFigure</tt> program from the book (available
on Blackboard), do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li> there are two rows of people, and</li>
	<li> the tallest person is half of what it was before.</li>
</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
