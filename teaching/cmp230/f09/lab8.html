<h3>Lighthouse</h3>

<p>
PP 4.4:  Create an Alice world in which a lighthouse stands on the
edge of some water.  Add a light source to the lighthouse that 
constantly turns.  Allow the user to click on the lighthouse with
the mouse to turn off the light and to turn it back on again.
Use the <tt>LightHouse</tt> class from the <tt>Beach</tt> gallery
and the <tt>DirectionalLight</tt> from the <tt>Lights</tt> gallery.
</p>


<h3>Motorboat Race</h3>

<p>  Add a timer to the motorboat from <a href="lab7.html">last lab</a>.
It should track the time it takes for the boat to reach a finish line and
display it as a stop watch on the screen.
</p>


<h3>Ring Toss</h3>

<p>
PP 4.9:  Create a ring catching game using a <tt>torus</tt> and 
<tt>cone</tt> created from the <tt>Shapes</tt> gallery.  The ring
should fall from the sky while the user moves the cone along the 
ground with the mouse.  The user's objective is to catch the ring
with the cone.  Following each attempt, reset the ring's position.
Stop when the user has caught 10 rings.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
