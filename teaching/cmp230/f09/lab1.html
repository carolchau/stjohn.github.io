<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
The department has the following policies for
the lab:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> There is no eating or drinking in the lab. </li>
  <li> Due to restricted class sizes, children are not allowed in the
computer labs. </li>
  <li> Do not waste paper-- only print files that directly relate to
the class. </li>
  <li> Do not enter the lab until the scheduled class time. If the lab
is open before class time, it is because another class is using it or
for maintenance. </li>
  <li> Always log out and turn off the monitor when you leave the lab. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
First, turn on the computer-- the button is
in the front. The monitor should also come on, if it doesn't,
the button for it is also in the front. It will take a few moments for
the computer to get started. Some machines in the department are set up
as dual boot.  If yours is, you will then see a RedHat logo
on the left hand side of the screen, and the words <tt>linux</tt>
and <tt>win</tt> in a white box on the right. Choose <tt>win </tt>and
hit return. These machines are "dual-boot," with both Linux
and Windows. By choosing <tt>win</tt>, the machine will boot up
under the Windows operating system.

<h3>Getting Started with Alice</h3>
<p>
Open the Alice animation system and choose <tt>Open World</tt> from the 
<tt>File Menu</tt> (this should automatically open when you open Alice).   
Click on the <tt>Tutorial</tt> tab, and choose Tutorial 1.  Work through 
the entire tutorial.  Note more explicit directions on starting Alice can 
be found in the textbook.

<h3>Favorite Animal</h3>

<p>Create a world for your favorite animal (chosen from the <tt>Animals</tt> 
gallery).  Have your animal do at least three things.</p>




<h3>Moving Vehicles</h3>

<p>

</p>

<p>Alice has a simple way to do statements at the same time:  you 
place those statements inside a <tt>Do Together</tt> block.  </tt></p>

<p>
Do <b>one</b> of the Programming Project 1.4 or 1.5 (p 22) and 
create a set of vehicles (either planes and other flying objects, 
or various boats) that move around the world.  You must have at
least three objects that move at different speeds and in 
different directions.
</p>

<h3>Combination Lock</h3>

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Objects/ComboLock.png">

<p>
Programming Project 1.2 (p 21): Create an Alice world that shows a 
combination lock being dialed and then the latch opening.  Instead of
the suggested combination, use for the first two numbers the day
and month that you were born.  The <tt>ComboLock</tt> class
is in the <b>Objects</b> gallery.<br>
(Hint: the lock is made up of a latch and a dial.  Experiment with
rolling and moving these components.)

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
