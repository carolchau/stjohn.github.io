<h2>Lab 14</h2>
<h3>CMP 230: Programming Methods I <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2009<br><br>
</h3>

<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today, we continue with Java.  This is the first lab focusing on events.
</p>

<h3>Snowman</h3>

<p>Make a copy of the <tt>Snowman</tt> program (consisting of 
<tt>Snowman.java</tt>, <tt>SnowmanPanel.java</tt>, and 
<tt>SnowmanDrawPanel.java</tt>) to use as the base for
this program.  Your program should have all the features of the 
<tt>Snowman</tt> program, and also have an additional set of radio
buttons that allows you to change the color of the snowman's hat.
You should give the user at least three hat colors to choose from, 
and you should create an event listener for this new set of radio
buttons.
</p>

<h3>Filling Choice</h3>

<p>
<p>Make a copy of the <tt>Circles</tt> program  (available
from the CD or Blackboard) to use as the base for this program.
Add a check box, labeled <tt>Filled?</tt>.
Your program should draw three circles, either filled, if the 
check box is checked, or unfilled otherwise.  Your program
should also have a listener for the check box (see the <tt>Snowman</tt>
program for examples of check boxes).

<h3>Circles</h3>

<p>Make a copy of the <tt>Snowman</tt> program  (available
from the CD or Blackboard) to use as the base for
this program.  The program should allow users to enter the 
number of circles they would like drawn on the screen in a
text box and the circles should be drawn in panel.  You will
need a label, <tt>Number of Circles</tt>, a text box, and an
associated listener.  Instead of writing a new Circle class, 
reuse the one from <tt>Circles</tt> program.

<h3>Red Light, Green Light</h3>

<p>PP 7.3 (p 151):  Design and implement an program whose background
changes color depending on where the mouse is located.  If the 
mouse pointer is on the left half of the program window, display
red; if it is on the right half, display green.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Extra Credit</h3>
<h3>Mouse Odometer</h3>

<p>PP 7.1:  Design and implement an application that serves
as a mouse odometer, continually displaying how far, in pixels,
the mouse has moved (while in the program window). Display the
current odometer value using a label.<br>
Hint: Compare the current position of the mouse to the last 
position and use the distance formula to determine how far the
mouse has traveled.  Given two points (x,y) and (u,v), the 
distance formula is <tt>Math.sqrt( (x-u)*(x-u) + (y-v)*(y-v) )</tt>.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
