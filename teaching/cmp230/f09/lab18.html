<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today, we continue working on arrays, in particular, using arrays with functions.
</p>

<div>

<h3>Drawing Playing Cards</h3>

<p>Add to the <tt>PlayingCard</tt> class (available on Blackboard),
a method that will draw a playing card on the screen:
</p>
<pre>
  public void draw(x,y)
</pre>
<p>
where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are the coordinates of the upper
left corner of the playing card.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate your new method, create a driver program that
has a panel with several cards displayed on it.
</p>


<h3>Sorting by Suit</h3>

<p>Change the <tt>SortCards.java</tt> program (available on Blackboard)
so that it first sorts first by suit, then by rank.  For example, the
current sort program, if you entered:</p>
<pre>
  2 spades 3 diamonds 5 clubs 7 spades 8 clubs 
</pre>
would output:
<pre>
  2 spades 3 diamonds 5 clubs 7 spades 8 clubs 
</pre>
<p>Your modified program should group cards by their suit (clubs, 
diamonds, hearts, spades) first, then by their rank.  So, your program
would output for the above input:</p>
<pre>
  5 clubs 8 clubs 3 diamonds 2 spades 7 spades
</pre>

<h3>Sorting Hands</h3>

<p>Fill in the missing parts of <tt>Bridge.java</tt> (available on 
Blackboard).  That is, after the hands have been dealt and printed,
sort the hands and print them again.<br>
(Hint:  the file <tt>SortCards.java</tt> has code that might be
useful.)
</p>

<h3>Puzzle Piece</h3>

<p>
Write a class called <tt>PuzzlePiece</tt>. A puzzle piece will have a label 
which will be a number between 1 and 15 and the location of the puzzle piece 
(which will be the coordinates of the upper left corner). Your class should 
contain three constructors:</p>
<ul>
    <li> a default constructor that sets the coordinates to (0,0) and the label to 0,</li>
    <li> a constructor that has a single argument that is assigned to label and sets 
    the coordinates to (0,0), and</li>
    <li>a constructor that takes three arguments: the label, the x-coordinate, and 
    the y-coordinate (in that order) and sets the values. </li>
</ul>
<p>
PuzzlePiece should contain a move method:</p>
<pre>
    public void move(int dx, int dy)
</pre>
<p>that changes the position by <tt>dx</tt> units in the x direction and 
<tt>dy</tt> units in the y direction.</p>

<p>Finally, you should have a draw method:</p>
<pre>
    public void draw()
</pre>
<p>that draws a square containing the label, using the object's coordinates for 
the upper left corner.</p>

<p>
Write a second class called <tt>PuzzleDriver</tt> that uses 
<tt>PuzzlePiece</tt> and demonstrates its features. PuzzleDriver 
should construct two PuzzlePieces (one using the default constructor 
and one using the other constructor), it should draw the puzzle pieces, 
and it should move at least one of the pieces. </p>


<h3>Puzzle</h3>

<p>Write a class called <tt>PuzzleBoard</tt>. <tt>PuzzleBoard</tt> should 
store 15 <tt>PuzzlePieces</tt> (see above) and include the following methods:</p>
<ul>
    <li> a default constructor that initializes the 15 pieces as in the 
    demonstration below.</li>
    <li>a method that draws the puzzle pieces and the "Scramble" box.</li>
    <li>a move method that takes a point as its input. If the point is contained 
    in the "Scramble" box, it calls a second (private) method with a randomly 
    chosen position 1000 times. The purpose is to scramble the pieces, so the 
    puzzle can be played. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Your class should use the PuzzlePiece class written above. 
<tt>PuzzleBoard</tt> will be called by <tt>PlayPuzzle.java</tt>. For more 
information and hints, see here. </p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
