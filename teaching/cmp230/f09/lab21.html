<h3>CMP 230: Programming Methods I <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>

<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today, we focus on handling exceptions and file input and output.
</p>
</div>




<div>

<h3>Divider</h3>

<p>Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and
then divides the first by the second and outputs the answer.
</p>

<p>Catch any exceptions that might be thrown (i.e. when the second
number is 0) and handle it gracefully.
</p>

<h3>Letter Count</h3>

<p>
Modify the letter count program (available on Blackboard) to 
ask the user for a name of a file.  Your program should then count
the letters in the file and outputs the number of times each letter
occurs.
</p>

<h3>Doublespacing</h3>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for the name of an input file
and the name of an output file.  The program should create a 
double spaced version of the input file in the output file.
</p>

<p>
For example, if the input file, <tt>letter.txt</tt> is:
</p>
<pre>
This is my letter to the world,
That never wrote to me,
The simple news that Nature told,
With tender majesty.

Her message is committed
To hands I cannot see;
For love of her, sweet countrymen,
Judge tenderly of me! 
</pre>

<p>And the user specifies the output file <tt>double.txt</tt>
should be:</p>
<pre>
This is my letter to the world,

That never wrote to me,

The simple news that Nature told,

With tender majesty.



Her message is committed

To hands I cannot see;

For love of her, sweet countrymen,

Judge tenderly of me! 
</pre>
</pre>
<!--
<h3>Indices</h3>

<p>index out of bounds: game where the user tries to guess your
secret word, if they enter an index that's out of bounds, throw
the exception in the calling method and have it caught by the 
main loop...  
</p>given:  the outline of the program.  fill in the method that 
throws the exception


<h3>Credit Card Exception</h3>

<p>
The program <a href="../InfoDriver.java">InfoDriver.java</a>
asks the user to enter their credit card information to complete
an order.  The program does not check to see if the credit card
number is valid.  Modify the program to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
</ul>
make a new exception and throw it: come up with an interesting
class


 Not sure I want to explain arrays of abstract classes...
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>

<p>Make a new class, called <tt>TicTacToe</tt> which contains
a 3 by 3 array of <tt>BoundedShape</tt>, i.e.:
<pre>
BoundedShape[] gameBoard = new Bounded
</pre>
Derive a new class, <tt>Cross</tt>, from the <tt>BoundedShape</tt> class
from Chapter 9 (available in Blackboard).  Your class should draw a cross
(i.e. an "X") inside the bounding box.
</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
