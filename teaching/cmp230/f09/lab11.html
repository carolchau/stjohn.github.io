<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today's lab is our first using Java and the integrated development
environment (IDE) Eclipse.  The majority of the lab will focus on 
getting comfortable using Eclipse.
</p>

<p>
Eclipse is an open source program and is available on the CD at the 
back of the book, as well as at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads">
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads</a>.

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>A good reference on using 
<a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/jung/cmp230/IntroEclipse.pdf">Eclipse</a>
by Daniel Liang.</p>

<p>Remember before starting a project to go to <tt>File -> Switch Workspace</tt>
and change the workspace to your USB drive, so, that your work is saved on 
your drive instead of the machine's hard drive.
</p>

<p>
To start today, open up Eclipse and work through the first tutorial,
"Create a  Hello World Application".  It is on the terse side, but 
you should end up with a program that says "Hello World" in the console.
</p>


<h3>Circles</h3>

<p>If you haven't already done so, switch workspaces to be your USB
drive.  Create a new project, <tt>Circles</tt>, which will be used for
several projects over the next couple of labs.
</p>

<p>Next, import (<tt>File -> Import</tt>) the <tt>Circles</tt> files 
from the book (available off the CD or off Blackboard).  Run the 
program (you should see a new window with 3 colored circles) to make
sure it was imported correctly.</p>

<p>Modify your program to have:</p>
<ul>
	<li> 4 different circles</li>
	<li> one circle unfilled</li>
	<li> all circles have different size and color than the original.</li>
	
</ul>

<h3>Snowman</h3>

<p>
In the Circles project, copy the <tt>DrawCircles.java</tt> and 
<tt>CirclePanel.java</tt> to new files called <tt>DrawSnowmen.java</tt>
and <tt>SnowmanPanel.java</tt>.
</p>

<p>Use these new files to create a program that will display a 
snowman.  Some useful things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The names of the file must match the names of the class contained
		in them.</li>
	<li>Other than changing the name (of file and class), you will not
		have to change <tt>DrawSnowmen.java</tt>.</li>
	<li>Your snowman should be made up of at least 3 circles for the 
		body and include a face or hat.</li>	
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
