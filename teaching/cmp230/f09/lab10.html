<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
In today's lab, we focus on handling multiple objects via arrays in 
Alice. 
</p>

<h3>Bug Zapper</h3>

<p>
Create a world with a list or an array that contains bugs from the <tt>Bugs</tt>
gallery (in <tt>Animals</tt>).  When the world is played, the bugs should all
move quickly in different random directions.  When the user successfully clicks
a bug, it vanishes.  The game should continue until all of the bugs are gone.
</p>

<h3>Soccer</h3>

<p>
Create a world with a soccer goal and 5 soccer balls (see the <tt>Sports</tt>
gallery).  When the user click the mouse on a ball, move it towards the
goal, and then make the ball vanish.  Continue the game until all of the 
balls are gone.
</p>


<h3>Race Cars</h3>

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Car.png">

<p> 
Create a world where 5 cars are racing around a track forever.  Every
lap, randomly choose a car to move forward an extra 3 meters in 
front of the rest, to simulate different cars overtaking one another
in a race.
</p>


<h3>Take a Bow</h3>

<p>
Extend your rockette world from <a href="lab9.html">Lab 9</a> so that
one of the dancers, at random, takes a bow at the end of the performance.
(Hint:  make an array and randomly choose the index of the dancer
to taka a bow).

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
