<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today, we continue with Java.  This is the first lab focusing on events.

<h3>Image Flicker</h3>

<p>Extend the <tt>ImageFlicker</tt> program (consisting of 
<tt>ImageFlicker.java</tt> and <tt>ImageFlickerPanel.java</tt>) 
to show <b>five</b> images of your choice.  The user should
be able to view the images by typing <tt>1</tt> through <tt>5</tt>
to see the individual images, or the space bar to see a random
image.
</p>

<h3>Space Ship</h3>

<p>Extend the <tt>SpaceShip</tt> program (consisting of 
<tt>Spaceship.java</tt>, <tt>SpaceshipPanel.java</tt>, and 
<tt>SpaceshipFlight.java</tt>) to allow the user to change
the size of the space ship.  If the user types <tt>L</tt>,
the space ship should be large size; <tt>M</tt> should be medium
size; and <tt>S</tt> should be small size.

<h3>Traffic Light</h3>

<p>
PP 7.5 (p 151):  Design an application that draws a traffic
light and uses a key press to change the state of the light.
Each time the space key is pressed, change the state of the 
light.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Extra Credit</h2>

<h3>Capture the Creature</h3>

<p>PP 7.10:  Design and implement an application that plays
a game called <tt>Catch-the-Creature</tt>.  Use an image
(or a simple object) to represent the creature.   Have the 
creature appear at a random location for a random duration,
then disappear and reappear again.
The goal is to "catch" the creature by pressing the mouse
button while the mouse pointer is on the creature image.
</p>

<p>
Create a separate class to represent the creature, and 
include in it a methd that determines whether the location 
of the mouse click corresponds to the current location of 
the creature.  Display acount of the number of times the
creature is caught.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
