<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
For information about getting started, see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>.</p>

<p>
Today, we continue with Java.  This is the first lab focusing on events.

<h3>Push Counter</h3>

<p>Create a new project for the PushCounter program from the book (available
from the CD or Blackboard).  The program consists of the files: <tt>PushCounter.java</tt>,
<tt>PushCounterPanel.java</tt>, and <tt>ButtonListener.java</tt>.  Make sure it
runs in Eclipse.</p>

<p>Next, modify the program in the following way:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Add a button and a corresponding listener that will zero
		the counter (that is, when your new button is pushed, the 
		counter will be set to zero and that will be displayed in the
		text field).</li>
	<li> Add a button and listener that decrements the counter and updates
		the text field accordingly.</li>
		
</ul>

<h3>Shapes</h3>

<p>Make a program with three different buttons, labelled, <tt>Square</tt>,
<tt>Circle</tt>, and <tt>Oval</tt>.  Your program should also have listeners
for each of these shapes.  When the user clicks on one of the buttons, 
the corresponding shape should be drawn on the panel.
</p>

<!--Next time: instead of shapes, have the buttons create circles of
different colors, or stars.-->

<h3>Toggle</h3>

<p>Make a copy of the <tt>PushCounter</tt> program to use for this program.
Your program should have a single button on a black background.  If the
button is pushed and the background is black, the background turns yellow.
Otherwise, if the button is pushed and the background is yellow, turn the 
background black.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today. Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
