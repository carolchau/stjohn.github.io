<h2>Problem Set 6</h2>
<h3>CMP 230: Programming Methods I <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2010<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<p>
This problem set is based on the material in Chapter 6: Transistion to Java.
</p>

<p>We will be using the <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> IDE to program 
in Java.  A good reference on using 
<a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/jung/cmp230/IntroEclipse.pdf">Eclipse</a>
by Daniel Liang.
Remember before starting a project to go to <tt>File -> Switch Workspace</tt>
and change the workspace to your USB drive, so, that your work is saved on 
your drive instead of the machine's hard drive.
</p>

<p>You should complete <b>200 points</b> worth of programs
(with an additional 20 points extra credit possible). 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<ol>


<li><b>Tutorial</b> (5 points)

<p>
To start today, open up Eclipse and work through the first tutorial,
"Create a  Hello World Application".  It is on the terse side, but 
you should end up with a program that says "Hello World" in the console.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Circles</b> (10 points)

<p>If you haven't already done so, switch workspaces to be your USB
drive.  Create a new project, <tt>Circles</tt>, which will be used for
several projects.
Next, import (<tt>File -> Import</tt>) the <tt>Circles</tt> files 
from the book (available off the CD or off Blackboard).  Run the 
program (you should see a new window with 3 colored circles) to make
sure it was imported correctly.
Modify your program to have 4 different <em>unfilled</em> circles.

<li><b>Face</b> (15 points)

<p>
In the Circles project, copy the <tt>DrawCircles.java</tt> and 
<tt>CirclePanel.java</tt> to new files called <tt>DrawFace.java</tt>
and <tt>FacePanel.java</tt>.
</p>

<p>Use these new files to create a program that will display a 
snowman.  Some useful things to keep in mind:
<blockquote>
	&bull The names of the file must match the names of the class contained
		in them.<br>
	&bull Other than changing the name (of file and class), you will not
		have to change <tt>DrawFace.java</tt>.<br>
	&bull Your face should be made up of at least 3 circles for eyes,
		mouth, and outline.	
</blockquote>

<li><b>Bullseye</b> (10 points)

<p>Modify the <tt>Bullseye</tt> program from the book (available from the
CD or on Blackboard) so that:
<blockquote>
	&bull  the largest ring is white and the others alternatve accordingly, and</br>
	&bull there are approximately twice as many rings that are each half as thin.</br>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Coins</b> (10 points)

<p>Modify the <tt>CoinFlip</tt> program (available from the book or Blackboard)
so that it allows up to 10,000 flips.

<li><b>Random Circle</b> (10 points)

<p>In your Circles project,  copy the <tt>DrawCircles.java</tt> and 
<tt>CirclePanel.java</tt> to new files called <tt>DrawRandom.java</tt>
and <tt>RandomPanel.java</tt>.
Use these new files to create a program that will draw a single circle
at a random location each time.  </p>

<p>Hint:
 Use the random number generator to generate the x and y coordinates
		for your circle (an example of using random numbers can be found in
		the Coin programs and the LineUp (StickFigure) programs.</p>
		

<li><b>Tails</b> (10 points)

<p>Modify the <tt>CoinFlip</tt> program (available from the book or Blackboard)
so that the <tt>Coin</tt> class uses an <tt>isTails</tt> method instead of
<tt>isHeads</tt>.


<li><b>Verify</b> (15 points)

<p>Ex 6.1 (p 120):  Write a Java program containing a while loop that
verifies that the user has entered a positive integer value.
</p></li>

<li><b>Odd Numbers</b> (15 points)

<p>Ex 6.3 (p 120):  Write a Java program that uses a <tt>for</tt> loop
to print out the odd numberes from 1 to 99, inclusive.
</p></li>


<li><b>Stick Figures</b> (10 points)

<p>Using the <tt>StickFigure</tt> program from the book (available
on Blackboard), do the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	&bull there are two rows of people, and</br>
	&bull the tallest person is half of what it was before.</br>
</blockquote>



<li><b>Highest Number</b> (15 points)

<p>Ex 6.4 (p 120):  Write a Java program that reads in 10 integer 
values from the user and then prints the highest value entered.
</p></li>



<li><b>100 Circles</b> (15 points)

<p>PP 6.1 (p 121): Using the <tt>LineUp</tt> and <tt>Circles</tt> classes from the book (available 
from the CD or on Blackboard), create a Java program that draws 100 circles
of random size, color, and location.  Ensure that in each case the entire
circle appears in the visible area of the panel.</p>

<li><b>3 Heads</b> (15 points)

<p>PP 6.2 (p 121): Using the <tt>Coin</tt> class from this chapter, create
a Java program that flips two coins until one of them comes up heads three
times in a row. 

<li><b>Parallel Lines</b> (10 points)

<p>PP 6.3 (p 121):  Write a Java program that displays 20 horizontal,
evenly spaced lines of random length.
</p></li>

<li> <b>Star</b> (15 points)

<p>PP 6.6:  Create a class called <tt>Star</tt> that represents a five-pointed
star of a particular size and color.  Then write a program that creates 
and draws four stars of various sizes at different locations.
</p>

<li><b>Account</b> (25 points)

<p>PP 6.7 (p 121): Create a class called <tt>Account</tt> that represents a 
basic bank account, keeping track of the account balance and providing 
methods to process deposits and withdrawls.  Print an error message if an
attempt is made to withdraw more than the current balance.  Include a
<tt>toString</tt> method that summarizes the state of the account.  Create
a driver program that creates two <tt>Account</tt> objects and processes
various transactions.
<p></li>


<li><b>Dice</b> (20 points)

<p>PP 6.8 (p 121): Create a class called <tt>Die</tt> that represents a single
six-sided die (as in the the singular of dice).  Then write a program that creates
and rolls two <tt>Die</tt> objects 500 times, and counts how many times snake eyes
(both dice showing 1) comes up.
<p></li>

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 200 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 20 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
