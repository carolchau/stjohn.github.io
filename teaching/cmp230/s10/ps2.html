<h2>Problem Set 2</h2>
<h3>CMP 230: Programming Methods I <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2010<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<p>
This problem set is based on the material in Chapter 2: Methods &amp; Data.
</p>

<p>You should complete <b>70 points</b> worth of programs
(with an additional 7 points extra credit possible). 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<ol>
<li><b>Method Tutorial</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="../images/napTutorial.png">
</p>
<p>
Open the Alice animation system and choose <tt>Open World</tt> from the 
<tt>File Menu</tt> (this should automatically open when you open Alice).   
Click on the <tt>Tutorial</tt> tab, and choose Tutorial 2.  Work through 
the entire tutorial.  
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Kangaroo</b> (10 points)

<p>Methods are used to define behaviors for an object.  For example, 
in lecture and in the text, we have used built-in methods such as 
<tt>roll</tt> and <tt>move</tt> and created methods to make objects
(i.e. cheerleaders and frogs) jump.
</p>
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/kangaroo.png">
</p>

<p>
Create a new Alice world with a kangaroo (from the <tt>Animals</tt>
gallery).  Add a new method called <tt>hop</tt> that makes the 
kangaroo hop into the air and land again while moving forward a
short distance.  Demonstrate your new method by having the kangaroo
hop several times.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Flap</b> (10 points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Dinosaurs/Pterodactyl.png">
</p>
<p>
Programming Project 2.1 (p 37) asks you to create an Alice world in 
which a bird flies across the sky.  Use an appropriate class from the 
<tt>Animals</tt> gallery (i.e. the <tt>pterodactyl</tt> class) to make 
the bird fly.  Add a method called <tt>flap</tt> to the bird that causes
both wings to move up and down in unison one full stroke while move the 
bird forward a set distance.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Rowboat</b> (15 points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Rowboat.png">
</p>
<p>
Programming Project 2.4 (p 38):  Create an Alice world that shows a
person rowing a boat across the water.  Use an appropriate person from
the <tt>People</tt> gallery and an object created from the <tt>Rowboat</tt>
class in the <tt>Vehicle</tt> gallery.  Add a method called <tt>row</tt>
to the person that causes the person to make one stroke with both oars
and consequently causes the boat to move forward a randomly determined
distance.
</p>


<li>
<b>Random Numbers</b> (15 points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Bugs/beetle.png">
</p>
<p>
Programming Project 2.7 (p 38) asks that you create a world in which 
three beetles are seen scurrying around the ground.  Instead of beetles, 
create an object of your favorite animal (or bug) class.  Add a method
called <tt>scurry</tt> that causes the animal to turn in a random direction
and then move forward a random direction.  Duplicate that animal twice
and call the <tt>scurry</tt> method of all three objects several times 
from <tt>my first method</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Kangaroo with Parameters</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/kangaroo.png">
</p>
<p>
Modify your world with a kangaroo from <a href="lab2.html">last lab</a>
so that the <tt>hop</tt> method accepts a parameter that specifies
the jumping distance.  Demonstrate your new method by having the kangaroo
hop several times.
</p>
</li>


<li><b>Search &amp; Rescue</b> (20 points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Helicopter.png">
</p>
<p>
Programming Project 2.8 (p 38): Create an Alice world that shows a 
search and rescue opertation in which a helicopter flies in a pattern 
above the ocean, occasionaly stopping to hover for a while as if looking 
for something.  Eventually the helicopter swoops in to save a person who 
was adrift.  Create a <tt>hover</tt> method the helicopter that accepts
the number of seconds it should hover as a parameter.  Create a 
<tt>search</tt> method and a <tt>rescue</tt> method to handle those
aspects of the operation.

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 70 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 7 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
