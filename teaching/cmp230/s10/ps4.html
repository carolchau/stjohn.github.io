</p>

<p>
PP 4.2 (p 83):  Create an Alice world showing two frogs prepared
to jump.  When the user clicks on one of the frogs using the 
mouse, that frog should jump a random distance forward.

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Kitchen/oven.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 4.3 (p 83):  Create an Alice world showing a kitchen environment
with various appliances (refrigerator, oven, microwave, toaster) and
other appropriate items created from classes in the <tt>Kitchen</tt>
gallery.  Allow the user to click on the appliances to open and
close their doors and otherwise interact with the kitchen objects.

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Fantasy/dragon.png">
</p>
<p>
Create an Alice world with a dragon in it.  When you type `<tt>F</tt>'
the dragon should breathe fire.  When you type `<tt>S</tt>', a puff of
smoke should appear.  Both the fire and smoke should disappear after 
half a second.

<li><b>Kangaroo</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/kangaroo.png">
</p>
<p>
Using the kangaroo (with the <tt>hop</tt> method with parameters from 
<a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>), create a new world where the user 
controls how far the kangaroo jumps.  When the user clicks on a number
between 1 and 9, the kangaroo jumps forward that many meters.  For 
example, if the user clicks on the '<tt>6</tt>' key, the kangaroo jumps forward
6 meters.
</p>


<li><b>Horse</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Horse.png">
</p>
<p>
Create an Alice world in which a horse is relaxing in a field.  Use
the <tt>Horse</tt> class in the <tt>Animals</tt> gallery.  Define four
different basic actions for the horse (sway its tail, dip its head, 
whinny, etc.)  When the user clicks any key, have the horse perform
one of the four actions, at random.
</p>


<li><b>Lighthouse</b> (15 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Beach/LightHouse.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 4.4:  Create an Alice world in which a lighthouse stands on the
edge of some water.  Add a light source to the lighthouse that 
constantly turns.  Allow the user to click on the lighthouse with
the mouse to turn off the light and to turn it back on again.
Use the <tt>LightHouse</tt> class from the <tt>Beach</tt> gallery
and the <tt>DirectionalLight</tt> from the <tt>Lights</tt> gallery.
</p>


<li><b>Helicopter Simulator</b> (15 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Helicopter.png">
</p>

<p>
PP 4.5 (p 84): Create an Alice world in which a <tt>Helicopter</tt> from the 
<tt>Vehicles</tt> hovers , blades constantly turning.  Allow the user to:</p>
<blockquote>
	move the helicopter up and down using the up and down arrow keys,<br>
	turn the helicopter right or left using the right and left arrow keys, and<br>
	move forward using the space bar
</blockquote>
<p>
Build an interesting world to fly around to make it obvious the helicopter
is moving.
</p>


<li><b>Motorboat Race</b> (20 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Motorboat.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 4.7:  Create an Alice world in which a motorboat is controlled using
three arrow keys: the up arrow moves the boat forward and the right and 
left arrows turns the boat.  Set up a series of obstacles and gates to 
demonstrate the maneuverability of your boat.
</p>

<p>  Add a timer.
It should track the time it takes for the boat to reach a finish line and
display it as a stop watch on the screen.
</p>


<li><b>Ring Toss</b> (20 points)

<p>
PP 4.9:  Create a ring catching game using a <tt>torus</tt> and 
<tt>cone</tt> created from the <tt>Shapes</tt> gallery.  The ring
should fall from the sky while the user moves the cone along the 
ground with the mouse.  The user's objective is to catch the ring
with the cone.  Following each attempt, reset the ring's position.

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 100 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 10 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
