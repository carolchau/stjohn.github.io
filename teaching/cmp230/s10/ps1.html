<h2>Problem Set 1</h2>
<h3>CMP 230: Programming Methods I <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2010<br><br>
</h3>

<p>
This problem set is based on the material in Chapter 1: Objects.
</p>


<p>You should complete <b>50 points</b> worth of programs
(with an additional 5 points extra credit possible). 
</p>

<div>
<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
The department has the following policies for
the lab:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> There is no eating or drinking in the lab. </li>
  <li> Due to restricted class sizes, children are not allowed in the
computer labs. </li>
  <li> Do not waste paper-- only print files that directly relate to
the class. </li>
  <li> Do not enter the lab until the scheduled class time. If the lab
is open before class time, it is because another class is using it or
for maintenance. </li>
  <li> Always log out and turn off the monitor when you leave the lab. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
First, turn on the computer-- the button is
in the front. The monitor should also come on, if it doesn't,
the button for it is also in the front. It will take a few moments for
the computer to get started. Some machines in the department are set up
as dual boot.  If yours is, you will then see a RedHat logo
on the left hand side of the screen, and the words <tt>linux</tt>
and <tt>win</tt> in a white box on the right. Choose <tt>win </tt>and
hit return. These machines are "dual-boot," with both Linux
and Windows. By choosing <tt>win</tt>, the machine will boot up
under the Windows operating system.

<li><b>Getting Started with Alice</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="../images/skaterTutorial.png">
</p>
<p>
Open the Alice animation system and choose <tt>Open World</tt> from the 
<tt>File Menu</tt> (this should automatically open when you open Alice).   
Click on the <tt>Tutorial</tt> tab, and choose Tutorial 1.  Work through 
the entire tutorial.  Note more explicit directions on starting Alice can 
be found in the textbook.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Placing &amp; Moving Objects</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="../images/spaceTutorial.png">
</p>
<p>
Open the Alice animation system and choose <tt>Open World</tt> from the 
<tt>File Menu</tt> (this should automatically open when you open Alice).   
Click on the <tt>Tutorial</tt> tab, and choose Tutorial 4.  Work through 
the entire tutorial.  
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Favorite Animal</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/directoryThumbnail.png">
</p>
<p>Create a world for your favorite animal (chosen from the <tt>Animals</tt> 
gallery).  Have your animal do at least three things.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Penguin</b> (15 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Penguin.png">
</p>

<p>
Programming Project 1.1 (p 21): Create an Alice world in which a penguin
waddles towards a hole in a frozen lake, tips over, and falls in.  The
<tt>Penguin</tt> class can be found in the <tt>Animals</tt> gallery and
the <tt>FrozenLake</tt> class can be found in the <tt>Environments</tt>
gallery.  Use the <tt>Circle</tt> class (colored gray) from the 
<tt>Shapes</tt> gallery to make the hole in the ice.  In addition to 
the standard built-in methods, the <tt>Penguin</tt> class comes with a few
other methods that you can call to help with this animation.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Combination Lock</b> (10 Points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Objects/ComboLock.png">
</p>
<p>
Programming Project 1.2 (p 21): Create an Alice world that shows a 
combination lock being dialed and then the latch opening.  Instead of
the suggested combination, use for the first two numbers the day
and month that you were born.  The <tt>ComboLock</tt> class
is in the <b>Objects</b> gallery.<br>
(Hint: the lock is made up of a latch and a dial.  Experiment with
rolling and moving these components.)
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Moving Vehicles</b> (10 Points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/directoryThumbnail.png">
</p>

<p>Alice has a simple way to do statements at the same time:  you 
place those statements inside a <tt>Do Together</tt> block.</p>

<p>
Do <b>one</b> of the Programming Project 1.4 or 1.5 (p 22) and 
create a set of vehicles (either planes and other flying objects, 
or various boats) that move around the world.  You must have at
least three objects that move at different speeds and in 
different directions.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Helicopter Flight</b> (15 Points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Helicopter.png">
</p>



<p>
Programming Project 1.10 (p 23): Create an Alice world in which a 
helicopter lifts off the ground, flies in a wide circle, and lands.
(An object can move in a circle by moving forward and turning one
full rotation simultaneously.)  The helicopter's propellers should be
rotating whenever the helicopter is in the air.  The 
<tt>Helicopter</tt> class can be found in the <tt>Vehicles</tt>
gallery.
</p>
</li>


</ol>

<div>
<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 50 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 5 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
