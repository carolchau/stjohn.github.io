<p>
With two other people, work out the following problem:
</p>

<blockquote>
Create an Alice world with a jumping animal (e.g. a frog, 
a bunny, an insect) and have the animal repeatedly jump
a random amount into the air and then back to the ground.
<ul>
	<li> The animal should stop his jumping after he has
		a jump of over 20 meters.
	<li> You should display, using <tt>3DText</tt> the 
		height of the current jump and the highest jump
		thus far.
</ul>
At the end of the program, display the height of the 
highest jump.
