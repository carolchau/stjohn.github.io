<h3>General Information</h3>

<p>
A substantial part of the grade for this course is based on on-line
quizzes.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Topics:</b> The material for the quizzes comes primarily from the 
assigned reading from the textbooks.  Each quiz covers a chapter or
topic and can be completed in twenty minutes.  </p>

<p>
<b>Due Dates:</b> The target dates for
quizzes are located on the front page for the class.  These are the
suggested day by which you complete the quiz.  
<span class="targetDate">However, you may take
the quiz as many times as you like, up until the deadline for
each quiz. </span>  The deadline for most quizzes is three weeks
after the target date.  See the home page for this class for 
target dates and deadlines of individual quizzes.
 Any
quizzes you do not complete by the deadline will be assigned a grade of
0.

<h3>Blackboard</h3>
<p>
This
course will use the on-line Blackboard system for submitting work
electronically and on-line quizzes. Blackboard should be
accessible through your CUNY portal account (<a
 href="http://portal.cuny.edu/">http://portal.cuny.edu</a>). If
you have not used Blackboard in the past, information is available at
the Computer Center.&nbsp; They can set up your account and have
information sheets about using the system.</p>

<p>
<b>Timing Out:</b>
If the system times out and locks
your quiz attempt (happens rarely when the browser or PC crashes), send
me mail and I can clear the attempt so you can try again.</p>
