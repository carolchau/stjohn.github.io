<div>
<p>
This problem set is based on the material in Chapter 5: Lists and Arrays.
</p>

<p>You should complete <b>100 points</b> worth of programs
(with an additional 10 points extra credit possible).

<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Ocean/Shark.png">

</p>

<li><b>Ballet</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/PinkBallerina.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 5.1 (p 96):  Create an Alice world in which a group of ballerinas
dance in unison, making appropriate poses and turns.
</p>



<li><b>Rockettes</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/rockette.png">
</p>
<p> 
PP 5.2: Create an Alice world in which a line of Rockettes performs
various kicks and turns in unison.  Also include some moves that are
executed in sequence down the line.
</p>


<li><b>Dominoes</b> (5 points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Shapes/box.png">
</p>
<p>
Create a world with at least ten objects arranged like dominoes
(for example, you could use the <tt>Box</tt> class from the <tt>Shapes</tt>
gallery.  These items should all be in a list.  When the user clicks
anything in the world, the first item should fall over and strike the
second item, which should fall over and strike the third item, and
so on.</p>

<li><b>Even Rockettes</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/rockette.png">
</p>
<p> 
Create an Alice world in which contains a line of Rockettes.  Have
<tt>every other</tt> rockette kick, 
executed in sequence down the line.
</p>

<li><b>Shortest-to-Tallest</b> (15 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/AliceLiddell.png">
</p>

<p>Modify the Alice world, <tt>SortingDemo.a2w</tt> (available on 
Blackboard), to have an array of ten different people (it currently
has 8).  In the world, the program should sort the people, shortest
to tallest (instead of the tallest to shortest in the program).

<li><b>Soldiers</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/ToySoldier.png">
</p>
<p> 
Create an Alice world in which a group of 12 soldiers march in three
rows of four soldiers each.  After marching forward a certain distance,
have the soldiers halt and salute.  Use the <tt>ToySoldier</tt> class
from the <tt>People</tt> gallery.
</p>

<li><b>Airport</b> (10 points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Boeing707.png">
</p>
<p>
Create a world that simulates an airport with a control tower and
a runway.  A group of airplanes should be lined up, ready for 
take-off.  Store the airplane objects in a list.  One at a time, the 
airplanes should take off and fly away into the distance.
</p>

<li><b>Select-A-Penguin</b> (20 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Penguin.png">
</p>
<p>
Create an Alice world with 10 penguins in it and store the penguin
objects in an array.  When the user clicks on the <tt>0</tt> key, 
the first penguin in the list should jump up and down.  When the
user clicks on the <tt>right arrow</tt> key, the next penguin in 
the array should jump up and down.  Similarly, if the user clicks 
on the <tt>left arrow</tt> key, the previous penguin in the array 
should jump up and down.  
</p>
<p>For example, if the current penguin is the third one in the list,
and the user clicks on the right arrow, the fourth penguin in the list
jumps up and down.  If the current penguin is the last one in the list,
and the user clicks on the right arrow, the first penguin in the list
jumps up and down.  Similarly, If the current penguin is the first one 
in the list, and the user clicks on the left arrow, the last penguin 
in the list jumps up and down. 
</p>
<p>
Hint: Create a number variable called <tt>current</tt> that holds
the index of the current penguin.  Increment or decrement that 
variable depending on which key the user clicks.
</p>


<li><b>Bank Teller</b> (20 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/City/CityHall.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 5.4: Create an Alice world that simulates people waiting in line
at a bank teller window.  Randomly determine the amount of time it
takes to serve each customer.  When a customer leaves, each person
in line should move forward one space.  Display the wait time for 
each customer when the customer is finally served.
</p>


<li><b>Tank</b> (20 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Tank.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 5.9: Create an Alice world that plays a game in which a tank 
shoots at planes that are crossing in the distance.  Use the <tt>Tank</tt>
class in the <tt>Vehicles</tt> gallery.  Allow the user to rotate
the turret right and left and change the angle of the barrel up 
or down using the arrow keys.  Use the space bar to "fire" a ball.
Store various types of planes in an array to use as the targets, 
moving them across the sky at various heights and distances.  Keep
track of the number of hits.

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 100 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 10 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
