<h2>Problem Set 3</h2>
<h3>CMP 230: Programming Methods I <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2010<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<p>
This problem set is based on the material in Chapter 3: Decisions &amp; Loops.
</p>

<p>You should complete <b>130 points</b> worth of programs
(with an additional 13 points extra credit possible). 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<ol>
<li><b>Too Hot</b> (5 points)

<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/Snowman.png">
</p>
<p>
Create a world with a snowman and stove in it (found in the <tt>People</tt>
and <tt>Kitchen</tt> galleries, respectively).  In the <tt>my first method</tt>,	
add in an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement that the snowman jumps if he is within
2  meters of the stove.  He should do nothing otherwise.  Test your decision
statement by placing your snowman in different spots in the world.</p>


<li><b>Shrinking Bunny</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Bunny2.png">
</p>
<p>
Create a world with a bunny in it.  In the <tt>my first method</tt>,	
add in an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement that 30% of the time the bunny
doubles in size and the rest of the time the bunny shrinks to half of
its original size.  Play the program several times to show the affect.</p>
</li>


<li><b>Morning Dancing</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/PinkBallerina.png">
</p>
<p>
Create a world with a dancer in it (several are in the <tt>People</tt>
gallery).  Write an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement that causes the dancer
to spin in place two revolutions if it's currently morning.<br>
<br>(Hint: Use the <tt>Is AM</tt> world function (see Appendix
B of the book for more details)).
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Changing Colors</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/Snowman.png">
</p>
<p>
Create a world with a snowman and stove in it (found in the <tt>People</tt>
and <tt>Kitchen</tt> galleries, respectively).  In the <tt>my first method</tt>,	
add in an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement that the snowman turns red is within
2  meters of the stove, otherwise he turns blue.  You can control the color
of the snowman by using <tt>color</tt> from its list of properties.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Bike at Intersection</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/People/bikekid1.png">
</p>
<p>
Modify the <tt>Intersection2</tt> program (available on the book's CD or 
class Blackboard site) so that the bike turns left 75% of the time and
right 25% of the time.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Random Roo</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/kangaroo.png">
</p>
<p>
Create a world with a kangaroo under a tree.  Have the kangaroo move 
a random distance forward.  Next use an <tt>If/Else</tt> statement 
that causes the kangaroo to spin in place if he is farther than a 
meter from the tree.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Bruce the Shark</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Ocean/Shark.png">
</p>
<p>
Modify the <tt>Shark2</tt> program (available on the book's CD or 
class Blackboard site) so that Bruce potentially rises to the 
surface every other lap.
</p>
</li>


<li><b>Hopping Forever</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/kangaroo.png">
</p>
<p>
Using your kangaroo from <a href="lab2.html">Lab 3</a>, create a 
world where your kangaroo hops forever.<br>
Hint:  Use a <tt>While true</tt> statement.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Collision</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/CementTruck.png">
</p>
<p>
Modify the <tt>Collision</tt> program (available on the book's CD or 
class Blackboard site) so that when the trucks collide, a crashing
sound is played and the cement truck's right front wheel breaks loose
and continues to roll down the street.
</p>
</li>


<li><b>Stop Hop</b> (10 points)

<p>
Using your kangaroo world from above, add in a tree and have 
your kangaroo hop towards tree as long as the distance is greater
than 3 meters.<br>
Hint:  Use the <tt>distance behind</tt> proximity function (see Appendix B).
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Falling Object</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Sports/beachball.png">
</p>
<p>
Exercise 3.5 (p 63):  Write a <tt>While</tt> statement that causes an 
object of your choice (some possible ones: a ball, a skydiver, a water balloon, 
a meteor, etc.) to move down one meter as long as it is above a specific
object on the ground (e.g. a target, a person, a house, etc.).<br>
Hint:  Use the <tt>is above</tt> proximity function (see Appendix B).
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Ten Twirls</b> (5 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/Bunny2.png">
</p>
<p>
Exercise 3.9:  Write a loop statement that causes an object (e.g. a skater,
a bunny, a car, etc) to spin in place 10 times.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Count Down</b> (15 points)

<p>
Exercise 3.8:  Write a <tt>While</tt> statement updates the value of a
variable called <tt>seconds</tt> and displays it in a 3D text
object called <tt>countdown</tt>.  Start <tt>seconds</tt> at 10 and 
loop until it reaches 0.
<br>Hint: use the "what as text" function to convert your variable into
text that can be displayed on the screen.
</p>

</li>


<li><b>Odometer</b> (20 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Car.png">
</p>
<p>
Modify the <tt>SpeedingCar</tt> program (available on the book's CD or 
class Blackboard site) so that it displays the distance the car has
traveled while it is moving.  Continuously display the result on a
3D text object that stays visible in the upper portion of the display
window.
<br>Hint: use the "what as text" function to convert your variable into
text that can be displayed on the screen.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Biplane</b> (10 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Vehicles/Biplane.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 3.2 (p 64): Create an Alice world in which a <tt>Biplane</tt> from the <tt>Vehicles</tt>
gallery flies in from the right side of the viewing area, makes seven 
consecutive veritcal loops as it moves across the sky, then flies off to
the left.  Its propeller should be turning the entire time.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Frog Race</b> (15 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Animals/frog.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 3.5:  Create an Alice world in which two frogs race toward
a finish line.  Use a loop in which both frogs hop forward in each 
iteration.  Determine the distance of each hop randomly.  End the
animation when one of the frogs crosses the finish line.  The <tt>Frog</tt>
class is in the <tt>Animals</tt> gallery.  
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Bouncing Ball</b> (20 points)
<p>
<img width="100" src="http://alice.org/gallery/Sports/toyball.png">
</p>
<p>
PP 3.6:  Create an Alice world in which a ball rolls off a table,
bounces on the ground, and eventually comes to rest.  Use the 
<tt>ToyBall</tt> class from the <tt>Sports</tt> gallery to create
the ball.  Use a loop to control the bounces, 
decreasing the height of the rebound by half every time.  Move the
ball away from the table slightly on each bounce.  Continue the bounces until the 
rebound height decreases to an insignificant amount.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 130 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 13 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
