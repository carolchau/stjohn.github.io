<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not to be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> The self-test questions on p 172.
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<p>
<p>
<dt><b>P14.</b> Write a program that asks the user for 
        information about an employee, including their
        salary.  The program will then print the employee's
        salary for 5 years, after asking the user for 
        the percent raise to give.
	<p>
	Here's a sample run:
<tt>
<br>Please enter your name: <b>Bill Clinton</b>
<br>Please enter your address: <b>1600 Pennsylvania Ave.</b>
<br>Please enter your phone number: <b>5555555</b>
<br>Please enter your salary: <b>200000</b>
<br>
<br>What percent raise do you expect? <b>5</b>
<br>
<br>Salary for Bill Clinton:
<br>Year 1:	$200000
<br>Year 2:	$210000
<br>Year 3:	$220500
<br>Year 4:	$231525
<br>Year 3:	$243101.25
<br>
</tt>
(The words in <b>bold</b> were entered by the user.)
<p>
(Hint: Use a loop, and don't worry about formatting the salary
(that is, how many places after the decimal are displayed) since
we haven't talked about how to do that yet.)

<p>
<dt><b>P15.</b> Modify the <tt>Employee</tt> class from 
	<a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> to include the name
        of the employee's boss.  This should be a private
        variable, and you need to include two new methods
        <tt>getBoss()</tt> and <tt>setBoss</tt> for accessing
        and changing the boss.
	<p>
        Note: To demonstrate these changes, you will need to 
        modify <tt>testEmployee.java</tt> (also from Lab 7).
