<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<p>
<p>
<dt><b>P15.</b> Write a program that stores 10 words, that the user
	enters, and then sorts the words alphabetically.<br>
	An example run of the program is below:<br>
<tt>
  Enter word 1: <B>cat</B><BR>
  Enter word 2: <B>bat</B><BR>
  Enter word 3: <B>dog</B><BR>
  Enter word 4: <B>aardvark</B><BR>
  Enter word 5: <b>zebra</b><BR>
  Enter word 6: <b>camel</b><BR>
  Enter word 7: <b>eel</b><BR>
  Enter word 8: <b>elephant</b><BR>
  Enter word 9: <b>lion</b><BR>
  Enter word 10: <b>bear</b>
<br><br>
The sorted list is:<br>
aardvark bat bear camel cat dog eel elephant lion zebra
</tt>
<br>
(Words entered by the user are in <b>bold</b>.)
<p>
<dt><b>P16.</b> Write a program to play Blackjack.  Your program
	should use the <TT>DeckOfCards</TT> class which can be
	found in <a href=""DeckOfCards.java>DeckOfCards.java</a>.
	You should first declare an object of class type
	<tt>DeckOfCards</tt> and use <tt>new</tt> to allocate
	space:
<pre>DeckOfCards myDeck = new DeckOfCards()
</pre>
	The default constructor initializes all 52 cards.  Before
	using the deck you should use the <tt>shuffle()</tt> to 
	make sure the deck is in random order:
<pre>myDeck.shuffle()</pre>
	Now, print out the top 2 cards on your deck.  If the sum
        of their ranks is 21, print out "You win!" and quit the
        program.  If the sum is < 21, ask the user if they would
        like another card.  If not, quit.  If so, print out the
        next card on the deck and the sum of the ranks.  Repeat
        this process until the user quits, the total of their
        cards is greater than or equal to 21, or they have 5
        cards.  
        <p>
        An example run follows:<br>
<TT><br>

  Your cards are:<BR>
  2 Clubs<BR>
  Jack Spades<BR>
<BR>
  Your total is 12.  <BR>
  Do you want another card? <b>y</b><BR>
<br>
  Your cards are:<BR>
  2 Clubs<BR>
  Jack Spades<BR>
  3 Hearts<BR>
  <BR><br>
  Your total is 15.  <BR>
  Do you want another card? <b>y</b><BR>
  <BR><br>
  Your cards are:<BR>
  2 Clubs<BR>
  Jack Spades<BR>
  3 Hearts<BR>
  7 Clubs<BR>
<br>
  Your total is 23.  <BR>
  You lost!  <BR>
  Thank you for playing!<BR>
</TT>
<p>
	Hints:<BR>
	<ul>
		<li>To make the program easier, assume that Jacks, Queens, and
		Kings are worth 10 and the Aces are worth 11.
		<li>First, get things working for 2 cards.  Then use a loop
		for 3, 4 and 5 cards.
	</ul>
