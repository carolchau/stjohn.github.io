<h1>Laboratory Exercise 5</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
6 October 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab is on decisions and loops.  Reading 
Sections 3.1-3.2 in the textbook will make this lab easier.

<h3>Maximum Score</h3>

The program <a href="ExamAverager.java">ExamAverager.java</a>
from the textbook (p 133) asks the user to enter exam scores and
prints out the average.  

<p>
Copy this program into J-Builder, compile and run it.
What happens if you enter no scores?  How do exit the program?
What do you have to type?  How many exams can you average?

<p>
Modify the program, to print out, not only the average, but
the maximum score for the exam.  You will need another variable
to hold the maximum score.  In that variable, store the 
highest score seen so far (you can test if another score is
higher by using an <tt>if</tt>-statement).

<h3>Minimum Score</h3>

After you add the code that prints out the high score, add
code that will also print out the lowest score for the exam.
This is done in similar way to finding and printing the 
maximum score.


<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Make sure that your program are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John, mail her copies
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
If there is still time left in the lab, work on 
<a href="hw5.html">Homework 5</a>.
