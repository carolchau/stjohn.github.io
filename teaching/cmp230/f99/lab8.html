<h1>Laboratory Exercise 8</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
27 October 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab is on classes and objects.  Reading
Section 4.1 in the textbook will make this lab easier.

<h3>Account Class</h3>

Last week, we used a class <tt>Employee</tt> that 
we wrote in lecture.  This week, we're going to write
a similar class, but for bank accounts.

<p>
Start by creating a file called, <tt>Account.java</tt>
which will hold the <tt>Account</tt> class.  This class
should contain the holder's name, address, 
social security number, and current balance.  Your class
should also have methods to print, get the current balance,
deposit and debit money to the account:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>public void print()</tt>
	<li> <tt>public double getBalance()</tt>
	<li> <tt>public void deposit(double d)</tt>
	<li> <tt>public void debit(double d)</tt>
</ul>
 
<p>
After you have your class file, you need to write a program
that uses your <tt>Account</tt> class.  Take the 
<tt>testEmployee</tt> file and modify it to also use
<tt>Accounts</tt>.  Set up accounts for two people, deposit
money to their accounts, print the accounts.  Also, debit
money from their account and print the accounts.


<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Make sure that your program are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John <b>and explaining why your
programs work</b>, mail her copies
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
If there is still time left in the lab, work on 
<a href="hw8.html">Homework 8</a>.
