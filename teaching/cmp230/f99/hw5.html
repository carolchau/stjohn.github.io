<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not to be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> The self-test questions on p 93.
	<li> The self-test questions on p 100.
	<li> Can you nest an <tt>if</tt> statement inside another
		<tt>if</tt> statement? 
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<p>
<dt><b>P10.</b> Write a program that prints out every fourth
	number from 1 to 100 (that is, <tt>4,8,12,...,100</tt>).  
	Use a loop.

<p>
<dt><b>P11.</b> Modify the <tt>Grader</tt> program from p 99
	to print out pluses and minuses for grades.  For example,
	<tt>A-</tt> for 91 and <tt>C+</tt> for 78.  If the
	grade is greater than 60 and ends in 8 or 9, it gets
	a plus.  If the grade is greater than 60 and ends in 0,
	1, or 2, it gets a minus.
