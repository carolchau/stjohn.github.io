<h1>Laboratory Exercise 11</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
1 December 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab is on inheritance (see Chapter 6 of the textbook).
We will be using projects in JBuilder, since projects are a 
good way to keep multiple files in a program together.  
See <a href="lab10.html">lab 10</a> for more details about
projects.


<h3>Savitch's <tt>Figure</tt> class</h3>

Savitch has written a parent class <tt>Figure</tt> class, from
which he has extended to make a class <tt>Box</tt>, for drawing
boxes, and <tt>Triangle</tt> for drawing triangles.  Today,
we'll use his classes to draw a simple picture of a house.

<p>
First, set up a new project called <tt>Lab11</tt>.  In this
project, you should add the files:
<ul>
    <li> <a href="Figure.java">Figure.java</a> (the parent class)
    <li> <a href="Box.java">Box.java</a> (a child class)
    <li> <a href="Triangle.java">Triangle.java</a> (a child class)
    <li> <a href="GraphicsDemo.java">GraphicsDemo.java</a> 
		(the class that contains the <tt>main()</tt>)
</ul>
These files are in the book (p 306-319), available in the 
StudentData folder in the labs, and also on the web.

<p>
Compile and run the program.  What does it draw?  Modify 
<tt>GraphicsDemo.java</tt> so that the program draws a simple
house, using only boxes and triangles.  Note: using these 
simple figures, it is not possible to "nest" one box inside
another.


<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Make sure that your program are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John <b>and explaining why your
programs work</b>, mail her a copy of <tt>GraphicsDemo.java</tt>
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
If there is still time left in the lab, work on 
<a href="hw11.html">Homework 11</a>.
