<ul>
	<li> <b>Catalog Description:</b>
	    CMP 230: Programming Methods I. 4 hours, 4 credits. (NOTE:
	    For students who intend to major
      	    in computer science, mathematics or the
      	    sciences.) Formulation of algorithms suitable for
      	    computer implementation. Programming in a high-level
      	    language. Debugging techniques. PREREQ: Three years of
      	    Regents-level high school mathematics, or MAT 104.

	<li> <b>Textbook:</b>
		<i>Java: An Introduction to Computer Science and 
			Programming</i> by Walter Savitch, Prentice Hall, 1999
			(ISBN: 0-13-287426-1). 

	<li> <b>Programming Environment:</b> JBuilder, available 
		bundled with the book when purchased at the college 
		bookstore, or from the department.  

	<li> <b>Grading:</b> The grading for the course will be based on:
		<ul>
			<li> Programs:	        20%
			<li> Midterm Exam 1:	25%
			<li> Midterm Exam 2:	25%
			<li> Final Exam:	30%
		</ul>

	<li> <b>Exams:</b>  The exams will be 
		<ul>
			<li> Midterm Exam 1: Wednesday, 29 September in
				G 227.
			<li> Midterm Exam 2: Wednesday, 3 November in
				G 227.
		</ul>
		Since the
		final is comprehensive, if you do better on it than on one
		of the midterm exams, the score on the final may replace
		one of the midterm scores.  Note that the final will be
		long and difficult, so, it is an exceptionally bad idea to
		plan on taking advantage of this.  There will be no makeup
		exams, and you must pass the final to pass the class.

	<li> <b>Assignments:</b> 
		The programming assignments are available at the class
		website.   You may turn in programs at any laboratory
		session, but no program will be accepted after the last
		laboratory session of the semester.  If you wish to 
		improve a grade on any program, you may resubmit it
		for grading.
		<br>
		Full credit will only be given for those programs that
		run correctly and have good documentation and
		programming style.

	<li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
		overall design of the programs and homework.  However, for 
		specific
		programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.

	<li> <b>Computer Accounts:</b> The department does not provide 
		computer accounts.  You will need an account with e-mail
		access to turn in your homework.  Accounts are available
		to all students at the Computer Center, or, if you already
		have another account, you may use that.
