<h1>Laboratory Exercise 7</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
20 October 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab is on classes and objects.  Reading
Section 4.1 in the textbook will make this lab easier.

<h3>Employee Class</h3>

First, we're going to look at the class <tt>Employee</tt>
we wrote in lecture.  It's at
<a href="Employee.java">Employee.java</a> and a program
that uses it:
<a href="testEmployee.java">testEmployee.java</a>.

<p>
Copy each of these programs and load them into JBuilder.
(There's several ways to do this.  An easy way is to 
cut-and-paste into new windows in J-Builder.  You can
also save each as a file (on the floppy drive) in 
Netscape, and then open the files from J-Builder).

<p>
Build first the <tt>Employee</tt> class, and then the 
<tt>testEmployee</tt> class.  Run the <tt>testEmployee</tt>
class.

<h3>Adding Another Object</h3>

Modify your program from above to include another object
of type <tt>Employee</tt>.  Call this new variable,
<tt>theUser</tt>.  Add in Java code that asks the user
for their name, address, phone number, and salary.  Store
this information in the object <tt>theUser</tt> and then
use the member function <tt>print</tt> to show the user
what they entered.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Make sure that your program are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John <b>and explaining why your
programs work</b>, mail her copies
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
If there is still time left in the lab, work on 
<a href="hw7.html">Homework 7</a>.
