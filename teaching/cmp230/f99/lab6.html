<h1>Laboratory Exercise 6</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
13 October 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab is on decisions and loops.  Reading 
Chapter 3 in the textbook will make this lab easier.

<h3>Mystery Output</h3>

What does the following code fragment do?
<pre>
int i, j;
for ( i = 0; i < 5 ; i++ )
{
    for ( j = 0; j < 5 ; j++)
    {
        if ( (i+j)%2 == 0 )
        {
            System.out.print("*");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.print("=");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
</pre>

To figure this out, put the above code in a program, compile,
and run it.  What does the <tt>%2</tt> do?  How would the 
output differ if the test condition in the <tt>if</tt> statement
was changed to:
<pre>
if ( j%2 == 0 )
</pre>
Try it and find out.

<h3>Stars and Stripes</h3>

Modify your program from above, to print out:
<pre>
*****
=====
*****
=====
*****
</pre>
What did you change, and why?


<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Make sure that your program are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John <b>and explaining why your
programs work</b>, mail her copies
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
If there is still time left in the lab, work on 
<a href="hw6.html">Homework 6</a>.
