<h1>Laboratory Exercise 9</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
17 November 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab is on lists of objects  and is based on 
the playing card example from lecture.


<h3>PlayingCard Class</h3>

In lecture, we wrote a program that takes 5 
<tt>PlayingCards</tt> and sorts them by their rank.
In today's lab, we will use the same class for
our objects, but this program will sort the cards,
first by suit, then by rank.

<p>
For example, if your hand was:
<pre>
    Jack Hearts  2 Spades  4 Clubs  6 Hearts  3 Diamonds
</pre>
Your program would print:
<pre>
    4 Clubs  3 Diamonds  6 Hearts  Jack Hearts  2 Spades
</pre>



<p>
Start by copying <a href="PlayingCard.java">PlayingCard.java</a>
and <a href="SortCards.java">SortCards.java</a> from the 
webpage.  Load these files into J-Builder, compile and run
them.

<p>
Modify the <tt>SortCards.java</tt> program to sort according
to the above criteria.  Do not modify the <tt>PlayingCard.java</tt>
program.  
<ul>
	<li> First, make your program sort by suit.  
		Remember, to compare strings, you use <tt>equals</tt>
		instead of <tt>==</tt>.
	<li> Then add in an extra test in case the suit is the same 
		for two of the cards.
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Make sure that your program are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John <b>and explaining why your
programs work</b>, mail her copies
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
If there is still time left in the lab, work on 
<a href="hw9.html">Homework 9</a>.
