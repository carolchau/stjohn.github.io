<h1>Laboratory Exercise 10</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
24 November 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab is on using projects in JBuilder.  To demonstrate
their use, we'll continue working with the playing card example.

<h3>Projects</h3>

Projects, in JBuilder, are a way of grouping files for a program
together.  For example, our <tt>Employee</tt> programs had two
files: one was the "blueprint" for making objects of type
<tt>Employee</tt> and the other file contained the main program.
To keep these files together, we can create a project which 
will make a separate folder to hold these programs.

<p>
Today, we'll create a project to hold the files for our card
game.  Open JBuilder, and click on the <tt>New Project</tt> option 
under the file menu.  A dialog box will appear in the middle
of the screen.  The first line is where JBuilder will store
your files.  You should change it to say:
<pre>
a:\myprojects\bridgegame\bridgegame.jpr
</pre>
The next lines in the dialog box are for your name, a title
for the program, and a short description.  Fill these in, and
click on <tt>Finish</tt>.

<p>
It will take JBuilder a few seconds to set up the project.  When
it has, you will see a list of files on the left (which should
look similar to before) and a title page on the left for your
project.
<p>
Next, you want to add files to your project.  Click on the 
plus (+) sign above the list of files.  This will open a new
file for you.  Call the first file <tt>PlayingCard.java</tt>
and cut-and-paste the file from the webpage.  
(<a href="PlayingCard.java">PlayingCard.java</a>)
Repeat with 
<tt>DeckOfCards.java</tt> 
(<a href="DeckOfCards.java">DeckOfCards.java</a>) 
and <tt>Bridge.java</tt>
(<a href="Bridge.java">Bridge.java</a>).
<p>
Next, add to the end of <tt>Bridge.java</tt> two lines of code
that tell the user to "Press any key to continue" and saves
their answer in Junk.  This will keep the runtime window from
disappearing before you can view the output.

<p>
To compile and run your program using Projects is the same 
as before.  If you have troubles, see Lab 1 or ask for help.

<h3>Bridge Class</h3>

Compile and run your Bridge program.  It deals out the deck
of cards to 4 players (North, South, East, and West) and 
prints out their hands.  For today, you need to sort each
player's hands and print them out.  

<p>
Use the code from the SortCards program to sort each hand.
Note: you will need to modify it slightly since it sorts
an array called <tt>hand</tt> of 5 cards, and you need to
sort 4 different arrays (one for each player) of 13 cards
each.
<p>
Do not modify the <tt>PlayingCard.java</tt> or 
the <tt>DeckOfCards.java</tt> files.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Make sure that your program are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John <b>and explaining why your
programs work</b>, mail her copies
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
If there is still time left in the lab, work on 
<a href="hw10.html">Homework 10</a>.
