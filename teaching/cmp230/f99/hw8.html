<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<p>
<p>
<dt><b>P16.</b> Write a program that asks the user for 
        information about their bank account, including their
        balance.  The program will then ask for the current
	interest rate and print out how many years it takes
	for their account balance to double.  The program 
	should print out the balance every year (until their
	money doubles) and assumes that the interest is compounded
	yearly.
	<p>
	Here's a sample run:
<tt>
<br>Please enter your name: <b>Bill Clinton</b>
<br>Please enter your address: <b>1600 Pennsylvania Ave.</b>
<br>Please enter your social security number: <b>123456789</b>
<br>Please enter your balance: <b>1000</b>
<br>
<br>What is the interest rate? <b>6</b>
<br>
<br>Your balance is at
<br>Year 0:	$1000
<br>Year 1:	$1060
<br>Year 2:	$1123.60
<br>Year 3:	$1191.016
<br>Year 4:	$1262.477
<br>Year 5:	$1338.2256
<br>Year 6:	$1418.5191
<br>Year 7:	$1503.6303
<br>Year 8:	$1593.8481
<br>Year 9:	$1689.479
<br>Year 10:	$1790.8477
<br>Year 11:	$1898.2986
<br>Year 12:	$2012.1965
<br>
In 12 years, your money has doubled.

(The words in <b>bold</b> were entered by the user.)
<p>
(Hint: Use a loop, and don't worry about formatting the salary
(that is, how many places after the decimal are displayed) since
we haven't talked about how to do that yet.)
