<h1>Laboratory Exercise 4</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
22 September 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab is on the <tt>String</tt> class and 
its methods.  Reading Section 2.2 in the textbook
will make this lab easier.

<h3>Changing Words</h3>

Write a program that reads in a line of text and 
then outputs that line of text with the first 
occurrence of <tt>"hate"</tt> changed to <tt>"love"</tt>.
For example, a possible sample dialogue might be:
<br>
<br><tt>Enter a line of text:
<br><b>I hate you</b>
<br>I have rephrased that line to read:
<br>I love you</tt>
<br>

<p>
(The words in <b>bold</b> are those entered by the
user.)

<p>
This program is a modification of the <tt>StringDemo</tt>
program on p 61.  One way to approach this lab is to 
type in the <tt>StringDemo</tt> program and make sure it
compiles.  Then, modify it to search for the word, 
<tt>"hate"</tt> and replace it with <tt>"love"</tt>.  
After that, modify the program to let the user enter 
the phrase.

<p>
Make sure that your program are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John, mail her copies
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
If there is still time left in the lab, work on 
<a href="hw4.html">Homework 4</a>.
