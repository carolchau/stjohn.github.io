<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<p>
<dt><b>P1.</b> Programming Exercise 2, p 27.  

<p>
<dt><b>P2.</b> Write a program that asks the user to enter a
	phrase.  Your program should then print out the phrase
	three times and leave the phrases on the screen until
	the user hits a key.  <br>
	For example:
<ul>
<pre>
Please enter a phrase:
Hello world!
You said:
Hello world!
Hello world!
Hello world!
Please enter any key to end the program.
</pre>
</ul>
	Modify the program on p 18.  Note instead of
	reading in a single character, you need to read in
	an entire line. 
	<br>
	Hint: To print out a string variable named <tt>mystring</tt>,
	you could use the following statement:
<ul>
<pre>
System.out.println(mystring);
</pre>
</ul>
