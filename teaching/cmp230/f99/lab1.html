<h1>Laboratory Exercise 1</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
1 September 1999</h2>

<hr>
<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>

The machines in the lab run a modified version of
the Windows operating system.  Many features of
Windows have been disabled for security reasons.
For example, you cannot save anything to the hard
drive and you cannot "right click."  

<p>
The department has the following policies for
the lab:
<ul>
	<li> There is no eating or drinking in the
		lab.
	<li> Due to restricted class sizes, children
		are not allowed in the computer labs.
	<li> Do not waste paper-- only print files
		that directly relate to the class.
	<li> Do not enter the lab until the scheduled
		class time.  If the lab is open 
		before class time, it is because
		another class is using it or for
		maintenance.
	<li> Always log out and turn off the monitor
		when you leave the lab.
</ul>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

First, turn on the computer and monitor-- buttons for both
are in the front.  It will take a few moments for the 
computer to get started.  
<p>
When the computer is ready, you will see a login screen.
Type in <tt>c230</tt> for the username and leave the password
blank.  Next, you will see a message to insert a disk into
drive <tt>A:</tt>.  If you do not have disks with you, there
are some at the front of the classroom you may borrow.  They
must be returned at the end of the lab.  

<p>
Finally, you should see a Windows desktop.  Click on the icon
marked <tt>A:</tt> to access the floppy disk.  
Click on the icon marked <tt>Student Data</tt>.  This includes
files used for classes taught in the lab.  Choose the <tt>c230</tt>
folder.  You will see lots of JBuilder files.  Find the one 
called <tt>SavitchIn</tt> and drag it to the <tt>A:</tt>.
This will copy the classes used by the book onto your disk.
We will use these classes a lot, so, you will want a copy of
your own in the same folder that contains your java programs.

<h3>Using JBuilder</h3>

Click on the JBuilder icon.  This starts the Java programming
environment we are using this semester.  It's a sophisticated
package with many features we will not use at first.  We will
start with just creating a simple java file.  To create a file
choose <tt>Open/Create</tt> from the <tt>File</tt> menu.  Give
your file the name <tt>FirstProgram.java</tt>.  

<p>
Type at the very top of the file:
<ul>
<pre>
/* &lt;your name here&gt;
   &lt;your email here&gt;
   CMP 230-1, 1 September 1999
*/

import SavitchIn.*;
</pre>
</ul>
This is a comment saying whose program it is, followed by a
line which tells JBuilder that you would like to use the classes
that come with the textbook.
Now, type in the program on p 18 of the book-- it's a simple
program that is the basis of some of the homework for next 
week.  

<p>
Save your program (<tt>Save</tt> under the <tt>File</tt> menu).

<p>
Before our program will compile, we need to make sure that 
the book's package <tt>SavitchIn</tt> is open and compiled.  
To open <tt>SavitchIn</tt>, 
choose <tt>Open/Create</tt> from the <tt>File</tt> menu, and
choose <tt>SavitchIn</tt> from the <tt>A:</tt> drive (you may
have to change the file type to "All Files" at the bottom of
the <tt>Open/Create</tt> dialog box).  You can look at the
file by clicking on its name in the left hand box.

<p> 
When large projects are
assembled, it's referred to as building (it you recompile 
everything) or making (if you only recompile the parts that 
have been updated.  To compile <tt>SavitchIn</tt>, 
choose <tt>Build "SavitchIn"</tt> 
from <tt>Build</tt> menu.  If it compiles successfully,
there will be a message about halfway down the screen saying
so.  
Next, we want to compile the program.  
So, choose <tt>Build "FirstProgram"</tt> 
from <tt>Build</tt> menu.  If your program compiles successfully,
there will be a message about halfway down the screen saying
so.  If it didn't, there will be an error message in the bottom
right hand corner of the screen.  You will have to fix all errors
before going onto the next step (ask for help if this happens).

<p>
Once your program compiles successfully, you can run it by 
choosing <tt>Run "FirstProgram"</tt> from the <tt>Run</tt>
menu.

<h3>E-mail in the Lab</h3>

For security reasons, the graphical e-mail programs have been
disabled.  To mail programs, you can do it from home or another
lab (just attach them as a text file in Netscape Mail, Eudora, or 
your favorite mail program), or use a terminal window in the lab.  
<p>
To do this from the lab, first <tt>Copy</tt> your program in 
JBuilder (<tt>Copy</tt> is under the <tt>Edit</tt> menu).
Then, click on the <tt>Terminal</tt> icon.  Choose the 
<tt>Open</tt> option under the <tt>File</tt> menu and type
the name of your host (e.g. <tt>alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</tt>).
Next, type <tt>mail stjohn</tt>.  Using <tt>Paste</tt> under
the <tt>Edit</tt> menu, paste the program into the mail 
message.  Type a carriage return, a period, a carriage return
to end the message.  To log out of the terminal, type
<tt>logout</tt>.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

After demonstrating your programs to Professor
St. John, mail her copies at 
<a href="stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<h3>Programming Assignments</h3>

If you still have time, you should start the first homework.
You can obtain a copy of the homework by pointing your favorite
browser (you can choose from Netscape or Internet Explorer) to
<a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/">
http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/</a> and follow the links
for teaching and cmp230.  


<h3>Logging Out</h3>

Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer.  First, you should quit all 
applications.  Then, go to the <tt>START</tt> menu in 
the bottom left hand corner and select <tt>Shut Down</tt>.
Also, turn off the monitor (button is on the front
at the bottom right).

<p>
Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer
and to take any personal belongings.  It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
