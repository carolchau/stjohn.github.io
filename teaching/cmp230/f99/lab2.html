<h1>Laboratory Exercise 2</h1>
<h2>CMP 230-2: Programming Methods I<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
8 September 1999</h2>

<hr>

Today's lab relies on the section in the book
on Arithmetic operators (p 46 ff).  You might want
to look over that section before starting the lab.

<p>
For this lab (and the programs in 
<a href="hw2.html">Homework 2</a>), you
will need a copy of <tt>SavitchIn</tt> on your 
floppy disk.  <tt>SavitchIn</tt> is the book's 
package that makes input and output easier.  A 
copy is located in the <tt>c230</tt> directory
under <tt>Student Data</tt>.  It's easiest to 
copy this to your disk before starting the rest
of the lab (see <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a>
for directions). 

<h3>Dollars and Cents</h3>

First, write a program that takes as input an 
integer, which will be the amount of cents the
user has.  Your program should output, the amount
entered, in dollars and cents format.<br>  For example,
if the user entered <tt>1234</tt>, your program 
should output:
<ul>
<pre>
You have $12.34
</pre>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Hours, Minutes, and Seconds</h3>

Second, write a program that takes as input an 
integer, which will be the amount of seconds left in
class.  Your program should output the number of 
hours, minutes and seconds left in class.<br>
For example,
if the user entered <tt>1234</tt>, your program 
should output:
<ul>
<pre>
There are 0 hours, 20 minutes, and 34 seconds left in class.
</pre>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Make sure that both your programs are written in 
good style and have good documentation (include your name
and the honesty pledge).  After demonstrating
your programs to Professor St. John, mail her copies
at <a href="mailto:stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu</a>.
