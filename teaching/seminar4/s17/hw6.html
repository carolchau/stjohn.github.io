<h3>Data</h3>
We will use two different data sets from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/">OpenData NYC</a> and one from the NYC DOE.  The first two were used in 
<a href="cw6.html">Classwork #6</a>.  The third you will need to download:

<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page">Open Data NYC Planning</a><p>
	(scroll down to "School, Police, Health & Fire" and export as geoJSON, called <tt>schoolDistricts.json</tt>).
	<li> <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults">NYC Department of Education Test Results</a>
	(see <a href="cw6.html">Classwork #6</a> for filtering the data to a CSV file).
	<li> <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Library/p4pf-fyc4">NYC Library Locations</a> (download as CSV file).
</ul>

<h3>Assignment</h3>


<ul>	
	<li> In the <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.953.5608&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Hirt 2013</a> article, the author argues that American zoning differs from European zoning policies early on.
	She concludes with:
	<blockquote>
	One way or another, compared to Europe, today's America is not a "nation of homeowners," but, if I might end on a semi-serious note, it may well be a "nation of homezoners."
	</blockquote>
	Why does she mean by this?  What is unique about US land-use regulation, compared to the practices of the countries she cites in comparison (Germany and England)?  Your paragraph should be well-reasoned and include citations to the text.
	<ul>
			<li> #1:  Submit your paragraph as a <b>.pdf</b> file.
	</ul>
	<br>
	<li> The NY Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/19/upshot/forty-percent-of-manhattans-buildings-could-not-be-built-today.html?_r=0">upshot</a> article analyzes the number of buildings in Manhattan that could not be built under current zoning regulations.  Using the <a href="Â http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/index-map.page">zoning map</a>, can 
	<a href="https://aging.ny.gov/LivableNY/ResourceManual/Housing/III1i.pdf">accessory apartments</a> be built in your neighborhood?  Why or why not?
	Your paragraph should support your answer with references to your neighborhood's zoning.
			<ul>
			<li> #2:  Submit your paragraph as a <b>.pdf</b> file.
			</ul>
	<br>
	
	<li> Create a choropleth map using folium (see <a href="cw6.html">Classwork #6</a>).  Your map should shade the school district regions by the percentage of students reaching proficiency (a score of 3 or 4 and stored as a separate column in the spread sheet), across grades 3 to 8 (all grades), in mathematics.  
		<ul>
			<li> #3:  Submit your program as a <b>.py</b> file.
			<li> #4:  Submit your map as either a zipped <b>.html</b> or as a screenshot (<b>.png</b> or <b>.jpg</b>) file.
		</ul>	
	<br>
	<li> Make a map that shows the school district boundaries overlaid with markers for the public libraries.  Note that there is no shading for the school districts regions (so no need to link a data file when creating the choropleth layer) and setting the opacity to a low number will make the background map features more easily visible.  Each library marker should have a popup with its name.
		<ul>
			<li> #5:  Submit your program as a <b>.py</b> file.
			<li> #6:  Submit your map as either a zipped <b>.html</b> or as a screenshot (<b>.png</b> or <b>.jpg</b>) file.
		</ul>			

</ul>
