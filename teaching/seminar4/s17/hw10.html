<h3>Data</h3>

We will use two different data sets from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/">OpenData NYC</a> and one from the NYC DOE.  The first two were used in 
<a href="cw6.html">Classwork #6</a>.  The third is from <a href="cw7.html">Classwork #7</a>:

<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Districts/r8nu-ymqj/data">NYC School District Boundaries</a>
	(export as geoJSON, called <tt>schoolDistricts.json</tt>).
	<li> <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults">NYC Department of Education Test Results</a>
	(see <a href="cw6.html">Classwork #6</a> for filtering the data to a CSV file).
	<li> <a href="http://data.beta.nyc/dataset/nyc-zoning-districts/resource/6d635f4d-d225-48ad-b0e4-9820ed54c66f?view_id=e0d5313b-cfa1-420f-b53a-0f93003448bd">NYC Zoning Districts</a> (see <a href="cw7.html">Classwork #7</a> for filtering the data).
