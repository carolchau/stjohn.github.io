<h3>Github Webpages</h3>

As part of this week's homework, you need to create a github page for your neighborhood.

	<li> Follow through the options for <a href="https://pages.github.com">setting up a page</a> for your project (right under the "Ready to get started?).
	<p>
	More details from github: on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/">writing and formatting</a> and the <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">markdown language</a>.
	

	<li> Start including the pieces for this weeks' homework in your neighborhood page:
	<ul>
		<li> the name of the neighborhood,
		<li> the outline of the neighborhood (the .json file you created in the previous classwork for <a href="hw5.html">Homework 5</a>),
		<li> the basic demographics & statistics from the <a href="hw1.html">Homework 1</a>, 
		<li> the top ten for parking tickets (by licence plate) from <a href=hw2.html">Homework 2</a>,
		<li> the biggest 311 complaints from <a href="hw3.html">Homework 3</a>,
