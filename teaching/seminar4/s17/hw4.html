<h3>New York City 311 Data</h3>

We will use the 311 data collected for <a href="hw3.html">Homework #3</a>.

<h3>Assignment</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Choose one of the neighborhood rankings discussed in class (see <a href="cw4.html">Classwork 4</a>).  How do the following measures compare to your chosen ranking system:
	<ul>
		<li> ordering the neighborhoods by <a href="https://www.walkscore.com">walk score</a>.  Does it change the ordering?  If so, how?
		<li> ordering the neighborhoods by distance to the Empire State Building.  Does it change the ordering?  If so, how?
	</ul>
	Which does a better job at capturing the neighborhood ranking that you analyzed?
	<ul>
		<li> #1:  Submit a text or csv file containing the neighborhoods with their original ranking, as well as a column that has their walk score, and a column containing their distance to the Empire State Building.
		<li> #2:  Submit a paragraph (as text or <b>.pdf</b> file) comparing and contrasting how these three measures ranked neighborhoods.
	</ul>
	<br>
	
	<li> In class, we discussed measuring the similarity of neighborhoods.  Design a metric for comparing neighborhoods.  Your metric can be a single measurement or a weighted combination of many.  It must depend on measurable quantities.  
	<ul>
		<li> #3:   Submit as a text or <b>.pdf</b> file that includes a description of  your metric.  What did you include in your metric and why? 
		<li> #4:   How does your favorite neighborhood measure against those considered by 
		<a href="https://www.brickunderground.com/live/best-nyc-neighborhoods-for-college-grads-2016">Brick Underground</a>?  What did they value differently in their metric than you did?  Submit your answer in a text or
		<b>.pdf</b> file.
	</ul>
	<br>
	
	<li> Has the demographics of your neighborhood shifted over your lifetime?  Support your answer with the data (two useful sources of maps are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/census/2010/explorer.html">NYTimes Mapping America</a> and <a href="http://www.urbanresearchmaps.org/plurality/blockmaps.htm">Urban Research NYC Maps</a>) and relevant citations to this weeks' reading.
		<ul>
			<li> #5:  Submit your paragraph as a text or <b>.pdf</b> file.<br>
		</ul>	
	<br>

	<li> Using folium (see <a href="cw4.html">Classwork #4</a>), create a webpage with a zoomable map focused on your neighborhood.  Your map should include the a marker at the location of each 311 call.  The marker should have a popup message with the complaint type.  Use
	the first 500 lines from the data set you collected for <a href="hw3.html">Homework 3</a>.   
		<ul>
			<li> #6:  Submit your program as a <b>.py</b> file.
			<li> #7:  Submit a screenshot of your map (as a <b>.png</b> file).
			An easy way to take a screenshot is to use Preview (<tt>Preview > File > Take Screen Shot</tt>).
		</ul>	
	<br>
	(Note:  if you would like the markers to "cluster" as you zoom out, add the 
	argument <tt>clustered_marker = True</tt> when you create the marker.
	See <a href="https://blog.dominodatalab.com/creating-interactive-crime-maps-with-folium/">nice demo</a> for example.)
