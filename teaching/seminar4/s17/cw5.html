<h3>Standard Formats for GIS Data</h3>

Integral to this course is analyzing and visualizing GIS data.  There are several standard formats:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile">Shapefiles</a> (<a href="http://www.esri.com/arcgis/about-arcgis">ERSI's ArcGIS</a>)
	<li> <a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/">Keynote Markup Languange</a> (KML)
	<li><a href="http://geojson.org">geoJSON</a>
</ul>
Here's an <a href="http://apprentice.craic.com/tutorials/28">excellent summary & comparison</a> of these formats.


<h3>geoJSON</h3>

We will be primarily using geoJSON files for this course.
Use the <a href="http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0">geojson's mapper</a>, locate your home campus.  Mark the point (select from the menu on the right of the map).  
<ul>
	<li>On the right hand side, the corresponding geoJSON will be created.  
	<li> Save the file and upload to github.  
	<li> Commit the file and preview.  <br>
	You should see the a map pop up in the preview window.
	<br>
	(Here's a <a href="
	https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/">helpful example</a>.)
</ul>

<p>Here's a nice description of <a href="http://www.macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html">basic concepts of geoJSON</a>:
<ul>
	<li> Read/skim the description of different types. 
	<li> What types are in the geoJSON file you created above?
	<li> Using the mapper, add a polygon outlining 3 block around your home campus.  What was created in the corresponding geoJSON file?
	<li> Create an additional marker for MHC and add a line marking how you 
	would travel between your home campus and MHC.  What was created in the corresponding geoJSON file?
</ul>

<h3>geoJSON and folium</h3>

Folium provides a simple interface to leaflet.js for mapping geoJSON data.
Work through example from tutorial that uses a geoJSON layer for
<a href="https://libraries.io/pypi/folium">folium</a>.


<p>
<i>These have moved since this classwork was written, a similar version is
at <a href=""></a>.  Note that the rewrite of the examples assumes that you are using jupyter and displays in-line.  To save an .html file to diplay, you need to save it (<tt>mapName.save(outfile='htmlFile.html')</tt>)</i>

<p>
Using your the geoJSON file that you created.  What do the different 
tile options do?  That is, how do the following options change your
map:

<ul>
	<li> <tt>tiles='Stamen Terrain'</tt>
	<li> <tt>tiles='stamenwatercolor'</tt>
	<li> <tt>tiles='Mapbox Bright'</tt>
	<li> <tt>tiles='Stamen Toner'</tt>
	<li> <tt>tiles='Cartodb Positron'</tt>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Challenges</h3>

Through the <a href="http://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">open data project</a>, there are many geoJSON layers available.  Download some of the following and use folium to create different webpages displaying these <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page">political and administrative districts</a>:
<ul>
	<li> NYC Boroughs
	<li> NYC zip codes
	<li> NY Congressional Districts
</ul>
For each, choose an appropriate background map. Note that you can combine these with your own datasets (i.e. overlap your 311 complaints on top of zip codes or congressional districts).

<h3>Limits to Growth</h3>

The reading for today addressed limits to growth at a global level.  What limits are there to the number of individuals that could live in New York City?  

<p>
With your group, identify the following quantities:
<ul>
	<li> How much water does the average New York resident need daily?
	<li> How much electricity does the average New York resident use daily?  Does this differ seasonally?
	<li> How much garbage does the average New York resident generate daily?
	<li> How many acres are there in New York City?
	<li> What is the current population of New York City?
	<li> What is the average number of persons per acre in New York City?
</ul>

<p>  What factors could limit growth?  Using the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/projections_report_2010_2040.pdf">population predictions</a> from the reading,

<ul>
	<li> What is the current population of New York City?  How many more people are expected by 2030?
	<li> How much more water is needed?  What is the current capacity?  Is this a limit to growth?
	<li> How much more electricity is needed?  What is the current capacity?  Is this a limit to growth?
	<li> How much more garbage is generated?  What is the current capacity?  Is this a limit to growth?
	<li> What other limits to growth did your group find?
</ul>
