<h3>New York City Open Data</h3>

We will use a data set from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/">OpenData NYC</a>.
Download the files in CSV format:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49/data">NYC Subway Locations</a>
</ul>
Since the files are not that large (and lack easy-to-filter boundaries like zipcodes), we will use the entire file.

<h3>Assignment</h3>



		

<ul>
	<li> What is currently being built in your neighborhood?  Use <a href="http://newyorkyimby.com">YIMBY</a> or city resources to locate recent projects.  Look at 3 three recent projects.  Do they fit into the current zoning?  Why or why not?  
			<ul>
			<li> #1:  Submit your paragraph as a <b>.pdf</b> file.
			</ul>
			<br>	
	<li> In the readings for this week, <a href="http://www.environment.ucla.edu/perch/resources/gender-japa-summer-02007.pdf">Crane, 2007</a> found that commuting times for women are increasing and converging towards those of men, while 
	<a href="https://medium.com/the-opportunity-series/the-not-so-simple-commute-98326477648e#.iygdthgx8">Vance's survey</a> suggests that women, especially those of color, have the longest commute times.  Both cite data to support their conclusions.  Explain the seemingly contradictory conclusions using citations from the text.
			<ul>
			<li> #2:  Submit your paragraph as a <b>.pdf</b> file.
			</ul>
			<br>
			
	<li>  Using folium, make a map of the NYC Subway data set (see above).  Your map should:
	<ul>
		<li> have a marker for subway location in the data set, and 
		<li> a popup with the name of the station and line.
	</ul>
	When submitting:
		<ul>
			<li> #3:  Submit your Python program as a <b>.py</b> file.<br>
			<li> #4:  Submit your map as either a zipped <b>.html</b> or as a screenshot (<b>.png</b> or <b>.jpg</b>) file.
		</ul>	
	<br>			
			
	<li> Create a github page for your neighborhood.  

	<ol>
		<li> If you haven't done so already, set up a repository for your neighborhood project (see the getting started tutorials from Classwork 3 on how to set up a repository).
		<li> Follow through the options for <a href="https://pages.github.com">setting up a page</a> for your project (right under the "Ready to get started?).
		<li> Start including the pieces for this weeks' homework in your neighborhood page:
		<ul>
			<li> the name of the neighborhood,
			<li> the outline of the neighborhood (the .json file you created in the previous classwork for <a href="hw5.html">Homework 5</a>),
			<li> the basic demographics & statistics from the <a href="hw1.html">Homework 1</a>, 
			<li> the top ten for parking tickets (by licence plate) from <a href=hw2.html">Homework 2</a>,
			<li> the biggest 311 complaints from <a href="hw3.html">Homework 3</a>,
			<li> the map of where 311 complaints occurred from <a href="hw4.html">Homework 4</a>.
		</ul>
		</ol>
		Submit on Blackboard:
		<ul>
			<li> #5:  Submit the URL to your project on github.
			<li> #6:  Submit a screenshot of your project as a  <b>.png</b>  or <b>.jpg</b> file.
		</ul>
		<br>	
		
	
	<li> <b>Project Proposal:</b>  Write a short abstract of what your project will focus:  neighborhood, topic, types of data needed, possible sources of data.  Your proposal should include:
	<ul>
	<li> Names of team members,
	<li> Group statement:  Proposed topics or questions your team would like to address,
	<li> Group statement: What data sets you plan to use (must use at least 2 distinct data sets per team member in meaningful ways in your project), and
	<li> Group statement: What techniques and tools you are thinking about using,
	<li> Each team member:  Your personal interest in this topic (why are you a part of this team?), and
	<li> Each team member: How you plan  to contribute to the effort, that is, on what particular aspect of the project you will be take the lead.

</ul>
