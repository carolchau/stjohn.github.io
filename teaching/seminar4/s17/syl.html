<h3>General Information</h3>


<p>  <b>Description:</b>  <i>3 hours, 3 credits:</i>
Having examined a variety of important aspects of the past and present of New York City in the previous seminars, in this fourth and final seminar students analyze the interplay of social, economic, and political forces that shape the physical form and social dynamics of New York City. Students study important historical moments in social policy formation, such as the fiscal crisis of the 1970s and welfare reform, and focuses on important instances of development opportunities and challenges, from Robert Moses's highway system to a new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx to the reconstruction of the World Trade Center. By studying institutional agents of change- federal, state, and city governments, public authorities, private sector interests, community boards, and grassroots organizations- students come to appreciate the roles people take or are given in the decision-making processes of government, and the ways in which these roles are affected by patterns of access, inequality, and the operations of power.
The culminating projects of this seminar are small-group presentations of students' investigations of crucial issues affecting the future of New York City.
<p>
Each Seminar 4 takes a different approach to the common theme outlined above.
To understand the past, present and
shape future change, this seminar has two dual strands.  The first strand focuses on the physical form and social dynamics of New York City:
<ul>
	<li> <b>My Neighborhood:</b>  Who lives there?  Where did they come from?  Where do they work?  How do they commute?  How do they interact with government (311 data, city support services, and crime)?  How have similar neighborhoods evolved over time (census tract data)? 
	
	<li> <b>The Future of My Neighborhood:</b>  Who will live there (using data sources such as building permits, migration rates, birth rates as predictive measures)?  What will the physical intrastructure look like in the future?
	
	<li> <b>New York City:</b>  How has the city's population and infrastructure evolved over time?  Where is the city growing (using building permits, census data)?  How are city resources distributed across the neighborhoods?
	
	<li> <b>The Future of New York City:</b>  Where can more people live (considering transit, flood plains, current density)?  Where should more housing be added?  How will your plans necessitate changes in underlying infrastructure such as transit, utilities, educational and social services?  
</ul>

The second strand, woven through the course, are the technical and statistical tools to employ data.  For this, <b>profiency in Python programming is assumed.</b>  This strand focuses:
<ul>
	<li> <b>Aquiring Data:</b>  Using Python file processing commands and packages to utilize data in standard formats (e.g. CSV and JSON).  Scraping data from websites (introducing beautifulSoup, HTML, and regular expressions).  Cleaning data and if time, a quick overview of SQL.
	<li> <b>Analyzing Data:</b>  When is an observed pattern statistically meaningful and when is it a coincidence?  Using tools to recognizing features and manipulating data vectors (e.g. scipy, numpy).
	<li> <b>Visualizing Data:</b>  Graphing statistical data using standard packages (matplotlib and seaborn) as well geographic maps.  Use of more sophisticated visualization tools (e.g. bokeh).
	<li> <b>Technical Side Topics:</b>  Tools to share: using github, simple webpages and visualizations.
</ul>

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the assigned reading. Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from prior courses as needed using readings, old notes and homework.

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. 
You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's 
<a href="http://www.lehman.edu/academics/arts-humanities/documents/CUNYPolicyonAcademicIntegrity.pdf">Academic Integrity Policy</a>,
(available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). 
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. 

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming and written excercises are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will require work on design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must 
perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style.  Accompanying written analysis is expected to be written in standard written English (i.e. use complete sentences and proper grammar).
Unless otherwise noted, homework is due weekly by <b>4pm, Thursdays</b>, and are submitted via Blackboard.
<!--Approximately 12 programs will be graded thoroughly and returned with 
comments.  The top 10
grades will be counted for the homework score.-->
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>

<p><b>Classwork & Participation:</b>  Participation is essential to a successful seminar.  If you are going to miss 2 or more meetings (15% of the class), please contact MHC about rescheduling you to take another section which you can attend regularly). Every class meeting there will be graded group work or a short quiz. The top 12 grades earned will make up the class work grade. Out-of-class (field trip) attendance will also count in this grade.
<!--
Instead of mid-term examinations, weekly quizzes will be used to assess mastery of the material
<ul>
	<li> The quizzes have a 20 minute time-limit and are available via Blackboard.
	<li>
	As the semester progresses, quizzes will include review questions
as well as short programming exercises based on the homework.  
	<li> Quizzes may be taken as multiple times before the deadline.
		<b>There are no make-up quizzes.</b> 
	<li> All quizzes are open book, open notes, and you may use the Python shell.
	<li> Unless otherwise noted, quizzes are due <b>noon, Saturdays</b>.

</ul>
-->

<p><b>Out-of-class Trip:</b>  Every Seminar 4 is required to have out-of-class activities that enhance the learning experience.  Ours will be visiting the <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/channel/by-the-people/">By the People: Building A Better America</a? exhibit at <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org">Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsosian Design Museum</a>.  

<p><b>Project:</b>  A final project and presentation ("model city council") is required for this course.  The grade for the project is a combination of grades earned on the milestones (e.g. deadlines during the semester to keep the projects on track) and the overall submitted project and presentation.

<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Sets: 30% </li>
      <li>Classwork & Partipation: 30% </li>
      <li>Project: 40% </li>      
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Textbook:</b> There is no required textbook.  Readings for the course are linked off the main webpage.  

<p>
<b>Technology:</b> Students are expected to participate in the programming and computer exercises at each course meeting.  To do so, you will need a device with internet access and ability to run Python.  MHC laptops have Python installed as part of the OSX operating system.  See note below about upgrading to anaconda.

<p>
This course uses the <b>Python</b> programming language available from 
<a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a>.  	
We will be using the <a href="http://www.numpy.org">numpy</a>, <a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>, and <a href="http://www.scipy.org">scipy</a> libraries.  These do not come with the default installations of python, but comes with <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">anaconda</a> or visit the download pages of these libraries.
	
<p>	If you would prefer not to upgrade your Python installation (or would like to work through a browswer), there are several web-based services.  One that already has the libraries were are using is <a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com">PythonAnywhere</a>.
 


<!--
<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.
