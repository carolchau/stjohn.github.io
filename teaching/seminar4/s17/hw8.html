<h3>Data</h3>

We will use two different data sets from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/">OpenData NYC</a> and one from the NYC DOE.  The first two were used in 
<a href="cw6.html">Classwork #6</a>.  The third is from <a href="cw8.html">Classwork #8</a>:

<ul>
	<li> A geoJSON file with the regions.  For our first choropleth map, we'll use the NYC school district boundaries available from 
	<p><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page">Open Data NYC Planning</a><p>
	(scroll down to "School, Police, Health & Fire" and export as geoJSON, called <tt>schoolDistricts.json</tt>).
	<!--<li> <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Districts/r8nu-ymqj/data">NYC School District Boundaries</a>
	(export as geoJSON, called <tt>schoolDistricts.json</tt>).-->
	<li> <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults">NYC Department of Education Test Results</a>
	(see <a href="cw6.html">Classwork #6</a> for filtering the data to a CSV file).
	<li> <a href="http://data.beta.nyc/dataset/nyc-zoning-districts/resource/6d635f4d-d225-48ad-b0e4-9820ed54c66f?view_id=e0d5313b-cfa1-420f-b53a-0f93003448bd">NYC Zoning Districts</a> (see <a href="cw8.html">Classwork #8</a> for filtering the data).

<h3>Assignment</h3>


<ul>

	<li> 
	<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/">Five Thirty Eight</a>	 examined the price New Yorkers were willing to pay per month to trim a minute off their commute ($56/month).
	<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Srvy_JobsProximity.pdf">Kneebone & Holmes 2015</a> show that the proximity to jobs has decreased over time.  Focusing on the same data, 
	<a href="http://cityobservatory.org/how-important-is-proximity-to-jobs-for-the-poor/">Cortright 2015</a> tabulated the relative job accessibility data. The New York metropolitian region shows some gap by income, but a very large gap city/surbanan living:  those within the city are within commuting distance of 5.4 times as many as those in the suburbs.  

	<p>This difference was more pronounced that other regions.  Why are there so many more jobs available to city residents?  Use references from the reading to justify your answer.
		<ul>
			<li> #1:  Submit your paragraph as a <b>.pdf</b> file.
		</ul>
		<br>

	<li> Make a choropleth map shaded by the different residential zone densities.  See <a href="cw8.html">Classwork #8</a> for a template program and data sets.  Note that setting all commercial and manufacturing zones to 100, and residential from 1 to 10, based on their zone will emphasize the residential zones in the shading of your map.
		<ul>
			<li> #2:  Submit your program as a <b>.py</b> file.
			<li> #3:  Submit your map as either a zipped <b>.html</b> or as a screenshot (<b>.png</b> or <b>.jpg</b>) file.
		</ul>
		<br>
	<li> Using the English Language Arts test scores for New York City, make a choropleth map shading districts by the change in profiency from 2013 to 2016.  That is, districts where the percentage of students reaching proficiency has decreased should be shaded red; districts where the students reaching profiency has increased should be shaded purple. 
		<ul>
			<li> #4:  Submit your program as a <b>.py</b> file.
			<li> #5:  Submit your map as either a zipped <b>.html</b> or as a screenshot (<b>.png</b> or <b>.jpg</b>) file.
		</ul>
		<br>

	<li> <b>Project Timeline:</b>  As a group, submit a detailed timeline of when each milestone (data collection, analysis, visualization, and making the presentation) will be completed.
</ul>
