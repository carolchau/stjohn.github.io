Seminar 4:

Learning Objectives:

Seminar 4 is intended to be the culminating and synthesizing of the three previous seminars (The Arts in NYC, The People of NYC, and Science Forward), which asks students to examine policy issues and questions and come up with ideas and solutions applying the different tools (of the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences) that they have worked with in the previous seminars.  The idea of the seminar is to ask students to examine problems or issues carefully and critically and propose possible solutions—or at least new visions of the questions.

	<li> Automate the acquisition, analysis, and visualization of data using computational tools.
	<li> Use multiple archival and primary data sources to examine policy issues and questions.
	<li> Present their ideas to their classmates from across the Macaulay program, and to selected “expert” respondents.

Project:  The mayor would like to add 200,000+ units of new housing to the city.  Focusing on a single neighborhood, where can you add housing and how much?  Use sources from the NYC Open Data project (i.e. zoning maps, flood plains, DOT, DOE, MTA, etc) as well as US census and labor data to justify your choice, focusing on access to transit, jobs, education, and considering how this will affect current residents and overall equity.
