<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <tt> I really would like to know if there was going
    to be any lengthy proof related questions on the first
    exam, questions like you have asked on the midterm and
    the final ( e.g Randomly built binary trees etc.)</tt> <br>

    There will be proofs on the exam, since they are an integral part
    of the class.  But, there won't be any lengthy questions due to
    the time limitations.

    <li> <tt>I need to have the midterm solutions posted again on 
    your web page and if you could post a solutions to your final exam. </tt>
