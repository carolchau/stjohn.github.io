The hiring problem from CLR, Chapter 5 (second edition or class handout).

The algorithm analysed in the book:
<pre>
HIRE-ASSISTANT(n)
1  best = 0    //candidate 0 is a least-qualified dummy candidate
2  for i = 0 to n
3    do interview candidate i
4       if candidate i is better than candidate best
5          then best = i
6               hire candidate i
</pre>

We're analysing <i>cost</i>, instead of running time as before.  
Assume that interviewing has low cost C<sub>i</sub> and hiring is 
expensive, C<sub>h</sub>.
<ul>
    <li> The total cost is (nC<sub>i</sub> + mC<sub>h</sub>), 
	where n is the total number
	of candidates and m is the number hired.
    <li> The <b>best-case analysis</b> is the best candidate is hired 
	the first day, giving a cost is 
	O(nC<sub>i</sub> + C<sub>h</sub>) = O(C<sub>h</sub>), 
	assuming that C<sub>i</sub> << O(C<sub>h</sub>). 
    <li> The <b>worst-case analysis</b> is that a better candidate shows
	up each day and is hired.  This gives 
	a cost of O(nC<sub>h</sub>). 
    <li> The <b>average-case analysis</b>:<br>
	Assume each ordering of candidates is equally likely, then 
	the cost is O((ln n)C<sub>h</sub>). 
</ul>

Randomized version:
<pre>
RANDOM-HIRE-ASSISTANT(n)
1  randomly permute the list of candidates
2  best = 0    //candidate 0 is a least-qualified dummy candidate
3  for i = 0 to n
4    do interview candidate i
5       if candidate i is better than candidate best
6          then best = i
7               hire candidate i
</pre>

<hr>

An algorithm for an on-line version of the problem:
<pre>
ON-LINE-MAXIMUM(k,n)
1  bestscore = - infinity
2  for i = 1 to k
3    do if score(i) > bestscore
4          then bestscore = score(i)
5  for i = k+1 to n
6    do if score(i) > bestscore
7          then return(i)
8  return(n)
</pre>
