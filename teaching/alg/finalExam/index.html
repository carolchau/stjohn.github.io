</ul>

<h3>Exam Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li> The exam is closed book and closed notes.  
    <li> When taking the exam, you may have with you: 
    	<ul>
	    <li> an 8 1/2" x 11" (or A4) piece of paper filled with 
	    	notes, programs, etc.  
    	    <li> pens, pencils and erasers.
	</ul>
    <li> You may not use a computer or calculator.
<!--
    <li> All books and bags must be left at the front of
    	the classroom during this exam.  This is to keep 
	the aisles clear, so that I can easily
	reach people to answer questions.
    <li> You must be enrolled in the course to take the exam.
-->
    <li> When you enter the classroom, you will be given an exam.
	You may write your name on the exam, but <font color="red">do
	not open it</font> until instructed to do so.  This is
	so everyone has the same amount of time to complete
	the exam.
</ul>

<h3>How to Prepare</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Do the assigned reading.
    <li> Make sure you do all the homework that has been 
    	assigned.  The problems (or parts of them) make
	excellent exam questions.
    <li> Work through the practice problems from the 
	homeworks.  These (or variations of them) often
	appear on exams.
    <li> Work through the old algorithms qualifying exams.  
	A packet of the past exams is available from the 
	department office.
</ul>
