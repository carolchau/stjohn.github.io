<h1>Guidelines for Homework</h1>
<h2>CSc 72700: Analysis of Algorithms<br>
Graduate Center, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2001</h2>

<ul>
<li>Homework submitted for this course <b>must be your own work.</b>
Submitting work from friends, books, the web, etc, is plagiarism
and a breach of the honor code.  Such cheating will be prosecuted
and can result in your expulsion from the university.

<p>
If you discussed the problems with others or consulted outside 
references such as textbooks or webpages, you must cite those
sources for each homework problem.

<li>Deadlines for homework are as follows:
    <ul>
	<li> If you choose to turn in paper copies of your homework, 
	it is due at 4pm to the class mailbox in the fourth floor.
	<li> If you choose to turn in latex, postscript, or pdf versions
	of your homework, it is due at midnight.
	<li> Faxed and other electronic versions (word, rtf, etc)
	<b>will not be accepted.</b> 
   </ul>
<li>
Written homework should be typed, if possible, in LaTex.  If you
are unable to use LaTex, you may use other word processors, 
filling in the mathematics by hand as necessary.  You must submit the
final version as a latex, postscript, or pdf file.

<li>Some homework problems contain proofs.  For each proof, you should
include a complete statement of the statement being proved, any assumptions
used, and the method of proof (that is, "proof by induction," "proof by
contradiction," etc).

<li>
Some homework assignments contain programming.  You may use any high-level
language to implement these programs.  Before submitting a program for 
grading, you should:
<ol>
	<li> Make sure it compiles without errors or warnings.
	<li> Tested your program thoroughly.  Try many different
		inputs, and make sure your program comes up with the 
		right answer.  If test cases are provided, make sure
		program works for those.
    	<li> Include the honesty pledge at the top of each program:
    	<br>
	    /* I, &lt insert you name here&gt, pledge that this program is<br>
       	    my own indepedent work and conforms to the academic<br>
       	    honor code.<br>
     	    */<br>
    	<li> Include a comment with your name, your login, and a
    		short description of what your program does.
	<li> Make sure your program is well-documented with comments.
</ol>

</ul>
