<p>This outline has been prepared for the Computer Science curriculum committee
at the Graduate Center, Fall 2000.&nbsp; This is just a suggested outline
and syllabus and does not reflect the current policy of the Computer Science
department at the Graduate Center.&nbsp; For more information about the
current course requirements, see the official bulletin at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu">Graduate
Center</a>.
<p>The Analysis of Algorithms course is part of the core curriculum taken
by all students in the doctoral program.&nbsp; For many students, this
will be the only formal course in algorithms they will take.&nbsp; As such,
the course content was selected to provide a basis in algorithm design
and analysis and only an in-depth examination of a few special topics of
the instructor's interest.&nbsp; It is assumed that students wishing to
study algorithms in depth will continue with more advanced courses in the
area.

<p>The prerequisities for this course are the standard courses for an undergraduate
degree in computer science.&nbsp; The ACM has developed a guideline for
the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.computer.org/education/cc2001/report/index.html">computing

had basic algorithm analysis, algorithmic strategies, fundamental computing
algorithms, and a minimum of one year's experience with a high level language
such as Pascal, C, C++, or Java, familiarity with recursive programming
methods and with data structures (arrays, pointers, stacks, queues, linked
lists, binary trees).&nbsp; In particular, students should know (list taken

<p>The course reviews and elaborates on the design of algorithms and their
data structures.&nbsp; The review material covers searching and sorting,
and the more fundamental graph algorithms, with emphasis on correctness
and efficiency.&nbsp; Techniques for analyzing the complexity of algorithms
are covered in depth, and include advanced topics on recurrence equations
and NP-complete problems. Additional material includes advanced topics
on randomized algorithms, amortized algorithms, and data structure design.
<ul>
<li>
Review of recurrence relations, basic probability, and counting.</li>

<li>
Sorting algorithms: mergesort, quicksort, heapsort, sorting in linear time.</li>

<li>
Data structures: review of hash tables&nbsp;&amp; binary search trees;
red-black trees, disjoint sets, Fibonacci heaps.</li>

<li>
Graph Algorithms: review of elementary graph algorithms, minimum spanning
trees, and shortest paths; network flow, matchings, and dynamic graph algorithms.</li>

<li>
Analysis and Design: amortized analysis, dynamic programming, linear programming.</li>

<li>
NP-completeness and approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems,
such as Steiner Trees, Traveling Salesman, and scheduling problems.</li>

<li>
Introduction to randomized algorithms: analysis of quicksort, searching,
and matrix multiplication.</li>

<li>
On-line vs. off-line algorithms.</li>

<li>
Programming practice.</li>
</ul>
The course also includes selected topics (the choice of the instructor)
such as matrix operations, sorting networks, arithmetic circuits, string
matching, algorithms for parallel computers, number-theoretic algorithms,
and computational geometry.
