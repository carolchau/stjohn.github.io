<h3>Announcements:</h3>
<ul>
<!--
    <li> <font color=red>11 September: Class is cancelled and the
	university is closed to the tragic events today.<br>
	The due date for homework 2 is postponed until Friday, 
	28 September.  </font>
    <li> The <font color=red>electronic dealine</font> only for 
	Homework 6 has been postponed until Thursday, 29 November 
	at noon.</font>  
-->
    <li> Information about the <a href="finalExam/index.html">final exam</a>.
    <li> In Homework 8, there was a typo on the last graded problem.  As
	stated in the ungraded problems, LFU is not competitive and the 
	subject of the graded problem (instead of LRU). 
    <li> Lecture on Tuesday, 11 December will begin with a quick review of 
	the topics covered this term and questions about the final.  
	The second half of class will be on an application that uses
	several concepts discussed in lecture, chosen from the 
	following:
	<ul>
	    <li> Euclid's Algorithm
	    <li> RSA Encryption
	    <li> Graham's Scan (computational geometry)
	</ul>
	While the topic itself will not appear on the final,
	the concepts it embodies will appear.  More information
	about each is found in the topics section of the book.
	The topic covered will be up to a vote of the class.

    <li> Upcoming Office Hours:
	<ul>
<!--
	    <li> Friday, 19 October:  11-12:30 and by appointment.<br>
		I will be at the Graduate Center for most of the day,
		so, send mail if you'd like to come by at another time.  
	    <li> Tuesday, 23 October: 3:15-4:15.<br>
		Stop by to ask last minute questions about the exam.
	    <li> Office hours on Friday, 26 October have been postponed
		until Wednesday, 31 October, since I'll be at a meeting
		in Palo Alto on the 26th.  Send mail to ask questions or
		arrange a time to meet.
	    <li> Tuesday, 6 November, after class.
	    <li> Friday, 9 November, 11-12:30pm.
	    <li> Friday, 16 November is <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/csweb/Calendar/colloquium/fall01/nov16.html">Theory Day</a> at New York University.
		There are some interesting talks related to algorithms, and
		if you are interested in studying theoretical computer science,
		you should try to attend.  Due to this all day meeting, office
		hours will be cancelled on 16 November.
	    <li> Tuesday, 20 November, after class.
	    <li> The university will be closed on 23 November for Thanksgiving
		Break, so, there will be no office hours that day.
	    -->
	    <li> Tuesday, 11 December, after class.
	    <li> Friday, 14 December, 3-4pm.
	</ul>
    <li> We have a new lecture room!!!<br>
	Thanks to Joe, we have been assigned the room, 6495, next door
	to our old room.  It's larger and better set up for lectures.
	We will meet there for the rest of the semester.
    <li> If submitting your homework electronically, you can send it
	directly to the grader at: 
	<a href="mailto:ivm3@columiba.edu">ivm3@columbia.edu</a>.<br>
	For the programming part of assignments, send the source
	code separately from the rest of the assignment, in plain text with a
	comment on what platform it was built (windows or unix/linux). 
	That way, Igor can compile and run your program without re-typing!
    <li> This course assumes that you have completed an undergraduate
	algorithms course.  See <a href="algorithms.html">suggested
	guidelines</a> for more details.
<!--
    <li> The text book is <b>Introduction to Algorithms</b> by 
	Cormen <i>et al.</i>  Both the first edition (November 1990)
	and the second edition (July 2001) are now available.  You
	may use either edition for this course.  If you are planning
	to purchase a new copy of the text book, get the second 
	edition, since it contains expanded sections and updated
	results and references.  You can purchase the textbook 
	through many places including 
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>.
