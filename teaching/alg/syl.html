<ul>
	<li> <b>Textbook:</b>
		<i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> 
		by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, 
		McGraw Hill, 1990 (1st ed) and 2001 (2nd ed).

	<li> <b>Grading:</b> The grading for the course will be based on:
		<ul>
			<li> Homework:	        25%
			<li> Midterm Exam:	35%
			<li> Final Exam:	40%
		</ul>

	<li> <b>Exams:</b>  The exams will be 
		<ul>
			<li> Midterm Exam: Tuesday, 23 October in
				GC 3307.
			<li> Final: To be announced.
		</ul>
		Since the
		final is comprehensive, if you do better on it than on 
		the midterm exam, the score on the final may replace
		the midterm score.  Note that the final will be
		long and difficult, so, it is an exceptionally bad idea to
		plan on taking advantage of this.  There will be no makeup
		exams, and you must pass the final to pass the class.

	<li> <b>Assignments:</b> 
		The homework assignments are available at the class
		website.  No late homework is accepted.  The highest
		10 homework grades will be averaged to get your overall
		homework grade.  

	<li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
		overall design of the programs and homework.  However, for 
		specific homework assignments, all work must be your own.
