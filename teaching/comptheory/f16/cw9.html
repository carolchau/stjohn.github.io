Consider the context-free grammar (variation of the example from the textbook):
<pre>
S  -> NP VP
NP -> CN | CN PP
VP -> CV | CV PP
PP -> P CN
CN -> A N
CV -> V | V NP
A  -> a | the
N  -> armadillo | bat | cat | dog
V  -> talks | likes | jumps
P  -> with | for
</pre>

<ol>
	<li> Give two strings that are generated by the grammar.
	<li> Give two strings that are not generated by the grammar.
	<li> What is the shortest string generated by the grammar?
	<li> What is the longest?
</ol>
