Reorder the list of the functions below, by which grows the slowest (i.e. if these were bounds on running times of an algorithm which takes the least amount of time to run for n items) to the one that grows the fastest:

<blockquote>
n, n<sup>2</sup>, n<sup>3</sup>, n<sup>0.5</sup>, 2<sup>n</sup>, 
n!, lg n, n lg n
</blockquote>
