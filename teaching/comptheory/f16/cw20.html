In honor of the anniversary of the Pony Express, Google wrote a simple game:
<blockquote>
<a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/155th-anniversary-of-the-pony-express">https://www.google.com/doodles/155th-anniversary-of-the-pony-express</a>
</blockquote>

Describe a Turing Machine for this game.  You can think of having two different inputs:
<ul>
	<li> The arrow keys for which direction the rider moves, and
	<li> The object under the "read/write" head (open space, letter, cactus, fence, etc.).
</ul>

Submit your written description that your group devised.
