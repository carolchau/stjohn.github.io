For each of the following sets, state if the set is countable or uncountable.  If the set is countable, explain how you can make a list of all its elements that enumerates the set.
If the set is uncountable, use the diagonalization method to show that it is not.

<ul>
	<li> The names of the subway stops in New York City.
	<li> All odd integers (i.e.	1,-1,3,-3,...)
	<li> {w | w ends in 0} where &Sigma; = {0,1}<br>
		(that is, all even binary numbers). 
	<li> The real numbers between 0 and 1 (i.e. [0,1]).
	<li> All possible pairs of whole numbers.
</ul>

Submit your written description that your group devised.
