<p>
Finite state automata are often used as building blocks in complex programming such as video game design and multi-agent systems.  FSAs excel in modeling small number of actions but can be overwhelming complex for larger systems).

<p>
Design a finite state automata that models movement in an old computer game (find one that has a good image and uses jkl; for up, down, right, left...)

<p>Note that instead of "ACCEPT" states, your diagram should have labels that echo the state of the game.


A variation on finite state automata are Markov Chains.  The underlying state diagram is the same, but the transitions have probabilities, expand!

<p>Find image of coin flips or use population movement?

<p>
Design a Markov Chain for the following game:  spinner/dice- two players, first to roll 3 sixes?
