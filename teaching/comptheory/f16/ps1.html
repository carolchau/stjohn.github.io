Everyone is expected to do all the problems,but we will take turns on who presents the problem solutions to the class(every 2-3 weeks, depending on the number of students in the class). Withina week of presenting a problem solution to the class, you must submit a writtendescription of it, via the Blackboard system. The written solutionswill be posted on the Blackboard website for the class, so, they can usedby everyone to study for the exams. Since it's hard to writedown answers that are concise and are easily readable by all, if you wishto improve a grade on any problem, you may resubmit it for grading.</div><div><h2>Using Blackboard</h2>To use the Blackboard system for thiscourse, you <b>must be enrolled</b> in the course.  A login nameand default password are generated for each CUNY student.  If you have troubles accessing Blackboard, contact <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/itr/blackboard.php">Blackboard Support</a> in the Information Technology Division. You can also visit the Help Desk in the Computer Center (first floor, Carman Hall) in person. They can reset passwords and help with simple Blackboard issues.<!--<h4>Submitting Written Descriptions</h4>We will use the "Dropbox" option of Blackboard to submit your written descriptionsof problem solutions. &nbsp;The Dropbox is available off the main menu, andhas two options: Add or Send. &nbsp;The Add option stores a file in youraccount (but no one else can see it), while the Send option will send a copyto me. &nbsp;Use the Send option to submit written descriptions.<br>--><h3>Academic Integrity</h3>Quizzes and assignments are open book and open notes, but you may not accepthelp from others while taking your quiz. For assignments, you must acknowledgeall others (including books and websites) with whom you worked with or receivedhelp.  All work must be your own.</div><div><h2>Undergraduate Problems</h2>All students enrolled should complete the following:<br><br><ol>  <li> Give a state diagram of a DFA that recognizes the following language:  <br>  {w | w begins with a 1 and ends with a 0}<br>  (assume that the alphabet is {0,1}.)</li>  <li> Give a state diagram of a DFA that recognizes the following language:  <br>  {w | w contains at least 3 1s}<br>  (assume that the alphabet is {0,1}.)</li>    <li> Give a state diagram of a DFA that recognizes the following language:  <br>  {w | w has length of 3 or more and starts with a 0}<br>  (assume that the alphabet is {0,1}.)</li>   <li> Give a state diagram of a DFA that recognizes the following language:  <br>  {w | w has even length}<br>  (assume that the alphabet is {0,1}.)</li>  <li> Given the formal description of DFA M is   ({q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, q<sub>3</sub>, q<sub>4</sub>, q<sub>5</sub>}, {u,d}, &delta;, q<sub>3</sub>, {q<sub>3</sub>})    where &delta; is:  <table border=1px>  	<tr><td></td><td>u</td><td>d</td></tr>  	<tr><td>q<sub>1</sub></td><td>q<sub>1</sub></td><td>q<sub>2</sub></td></tr>  	<tr><td>q<sub>2</sub></td><td>q<sub>1</sub></td><td>q<sub>3</sub></td></tr>  	<tr><td>q<sub>3</sub></td><td>q<sub>2</sub></td><td>q<sub>4</sub></td></tr>  	<tr><td>q<sub>4</sub></td><td>q<sub>3</sub></td><td>q<sub>5</sub></td></tr>  	<tr><td>q<sub>5</sub></td><td>q<sub>4</sub></td><td>q<sub>5</sub></td></tr>  </table>  Give the state diagram of this machine.</ol></div><div><h2>Graduate Problems</h2>Students enrolled for graduate credit, should complete all the undergraduate problems, as well as:<br><br><ol>  <li> Give a state diagram of a DFA that recognizes the following language:  <br>  {w | w does not contain the substring 110}<br>  (assume that the alphabet is {0,1}.)</li>  <li> Give a state diagram of a DFA that recognizes the following language:  <br>  {w | w contains the substring 11 <b>or</b> the substring 00}<br>  (assume that the alphabet is {0,1}.)</li>    <li> Give a state diagram of a DFA that recognizes the following language:  <br>  {w | w contains the substring 11 <b>and</b> the substring 00}<br>  (assume that the alphabet is {0,1}.)</li>  </ol></div></body></html>
