<b>Topics:</b> Nonregular Languages (Chapter 1).<br>
<br>
An integral part of this class is understanding and presenting the problems
assigned as homework. Everyone is expected to do all the problems,
but we will take turns on who presents the problem solutions to the class
(every 2-3 weeks, depending on the number of students in the class). Within
a week of presenting a problem solution to the class, you must submit a written
description of it, via the Blackboard system. The written solutions
will be posted on the Blackboard website for the class, so, they can used
by everyone to study for the exams. Since it's hard to write
down answers that are concise and are easily readable by all, if you wish
to improve a grade on any problem, you may resubmit it for grading.

<h2>Undergraduate Problems</h2>
All students enrolled should complete the following:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li> Show that the following language is regular:<br>
  {00, 0000, 000000, ...} = {0<sup>2n</sup>| n &ge; 1}</li>  
  <li> Use the pumping lemma to show that the following language is not regular:
  <br>
  {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup>2<sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0}</li>    
  <li> Show that the following language is regular:<br>
  {&epsilon;, abc, abcabc, abcabcabc, ...} = {(abc)<sup>n</sup>| n &ge; 0}</li>    
  <li> Use the pumping lemma to show that the following language is not regular:
  <br>
  {www | w &isin; {a,b,c}*}</li>

  <li> Use the pumping lemma to show that the following language is not regular:
  <br>
  {0<sup>m</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | m &ne; n}</li>

  <li>Is the language:
  <br>
  {0<sup>m</sup>10<sup>m</sup> | m &ge; 0}
  regular or not?  Justify your answer.
<br>  
  

</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Graduate Problems</h2>
Students enrolled for graduate credit, should complete all the undergraduate problems, as well as:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li> Show that the complement of {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | n &ge; 0} 
  is not regular</li>
 
  <li>  Show that the language<br>
  	{w | w &isin; {0,1}* is not a palindrome} 
  	<br>is not regular (a palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backwards.)
</ol>
