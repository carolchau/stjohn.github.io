Write a program for Antony Morphett's Turing Machine Simulator:
<blockquote>
	<a href="http://morphett.info/turing/turing.html">http://morphett.info/turing/turing.html</a>
</blockquote>
that accepts all strings that have the same number of 0's and 1's.

<p>
Hint:  There are many, many ways to do this.  Write out some sample strings, and brainstorm about how you would do it by hand, then translate into pseudocode, then into a Turing Machine.
