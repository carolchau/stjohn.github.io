Everyone is expected to do all the problems,but we will take turns on who presents the problem solutions to the class(every 2-3 weeks, depending on the number of students in the class). Withina week of presenting a problem solution to the class, you must submit a writtendescription of it, via the Blackboard system. The written solutionswill be posted on the Blackboard website for the class, so, they can usedby everyone to study for the exams. Since it's hard to writedown answers that are concise and are easily readable by all, if you wishto improve a grade on any problem, you may resubmit it for grading.</div><div><h2>Using Blackboard</h2>See the <a href="hw1.html">first assignment</a> for information on usingBlackboard and submitting homework.</div><div><h2>Undergraduate Problems</h2>All students enrolled should complete the following:<br><br><ol>  <li>Exercise 1.7d.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.7g.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.7h.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.8a.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.9a.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.10a.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.10b.</li></ol></ol></div><div><h2>Graduate Problems</h2>Students enrolled for graduate credit, should complete all the undergraduate problems, as well as:<br><br><ol>  <li>Exercise 1.7c.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.7e.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.8b.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.9b.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.10c.</li>  <li>Exercise 1.13.</li></ol></ol>  </ol></div></body></html>
