Instead of turning in the whole problem set, each studentwill be responsible for presenting and writing up some of the problems. &nbsp;Thewritten solutions will be posted on the Blackboard website for the class,so, they can used by everyone to study for the exams. &nbsp;Since it's hard&nbsp;to write down answers that are concise and are easily readable by all,if you wish to improve a grade  		on any problem, you may resubmit it forgrading. 		<br>		Full credit will only be given for those solutions that 		are correct,clear, and concise. &nbsp;For programs, full credit will only be given forthose that run correctly and have good documentation and 		programming style.&nbsp;</li><li> <b>Exams:</b>  The exams will be 		<ul><li> Midterm Exam 1: Thursday, 11 March</li><li>Midterm Exam 2: Thursday, 22 April<br>      </li><li>Final Exam: TBA<br>      </li></ul>		Since the final is comprehensive, if you do better		on it than on one of the midterm exams, the score		on the final may replace one of the midterm scores.		Note that the final will be long and difficult, so, it		is an exceptionally bad idea to plan on taking advantage		of this.  There will be no makeup exams, and you must		pass the final to pass the class.	</li><li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the		overall design of the programs and homework.  However, for 		specific		programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.		<br>		You are responsible for knowing and following 		Lehman's 		<a href="acadPol.pdf">academic integrity code</a> (available from the Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic Standards and Evaluations).		<br>		All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice		President of Student Affairs.  	</li><li> <b>Computer Accounts:</b> You will be assigned a computer 		account on the Linux machines for work relating to this		course only.  More information about the computer accounts		and Linux machines will be available later in the course.</li></ul> <hr>This website for this class is located at: <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/comptheory/">http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/comptheory/</a><hr><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
