<h3>Announcements:</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Information about the <a href="s08/final/index.html">final exam</a> is now available.
<!--
	<li> There's a mistake in one of the past exams.  On page 1 of the exam from 
		Spring 2004, Problem 2c) asks for a DFA for the concatenation of two languages.
		It should be a <b>NFA</b> for the concatenation.  Note that while it is possible
		to come up with a DFA (create the NFA following the proof idea, then convert 
		to a DFA), it would impossible to create a machine that huge (with 2^9=512 states)
		for a two hour exam. 
	<li> Due to the upcoming exam, office hours this week are slightly different:
		<ul>
			<li> Tuesday, 12:40-1:30 (G 219), no late hours 
			<li> Wednesday, 11-1, 2-4
			<li> Thursday, no hours
		</ul>
		
	<li> Information about <a href="s08/exam1/index.html">Exam 1</a> is now available.
	-->
  <li>Since we will not have time to cover Homework 6 (Chapter 3) before the
  	second exam, it will not be included on the exam.  Instead, the exam will 
  	cover Chapters 0-2, Homeworks 1-5.
  <li>Afternoon office hours will start in Gillet 219 (classroom for my 11am
course) and move to Gillet 137 (Prof. St. John's office).</li>
  </li>
  <li><b>Who should take this course?</b> &nbsp;This course is aimed at undergraduate
and masters students who are planning doctoral studies in computer science,
applied mathematics, or mathematics. &nbsp;It is required by almost all Ph.D.
programs in computer science either the course itself or as prerequisite
to the doctoral level course. &nbsp;Many programs will allow you to "make
up" the course during your first year of doctoral study, but it is still
worth taking this course earlier rather than later since the material appears
on the GRE. &nbsp;The material is a mixture of computer science and mathematics,
so, will be of interest to computer science and applied mathematics students
considering doctoral study and mathematics students who are minoring in computer
science.</li>
  <li><b>What is computability theory?</b>
&nbsp;Computability theory studies such questions as "can I find an algorithm
that will solve this problem?" and "which problem is harder to compute?"
in a rigorous fashion. &nbsp;We will also cover automata and languages (regular
languages, finite state automata, nondeterminism, regular expressions, context-free
languages and grammars, and pushdown automata), computability theory (Turing
machines, decidability, and reducibility), as well as time and space complexity
and intractability.</li>
  <li><b>Should I sign up for undergraduate or graduate credit?</b> &nbsp;This
course is being taught both as an undergraduate and masters course. &nbsp;While
the lectures will be the same for the two courses, the assignments, reading,
and exams will be at a higher level for masters students. &nbsp;If you are
a masters students, you must take the course for graduate credit. &nbsp;If
you are an undergraduate student, it's suggested that you take this for undergraduate
credit. &nbsp;However, if you wish to take the course for graduate credit,
you will need to get the permission of the graduate chair, Prof. Berger.</li>
