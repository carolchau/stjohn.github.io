To use the Blackboard system for thiscourse, you <b>must be enrolled</b> in the course.  A login nameand default password are generated for each enrolled student.These should be available during the first week of class from the Academic Computer Center.<h4>Logging In</h4>Once you have your login, access the Blackboard server at:<a href="http://blackboard.lehman.cuny.edu">http://blackboard.lehman.cuny.edu</a> Click the Login button, type your username, press Tab (not Enter), type your password, and click OK.  You may have to repeat this processthe first time you access Blackboard.<p>You should change your password regularly.  To change your password, choose the "Personal Information" menu from the left hand side of theBlackboard window, and then choose "Change Password."</p><h4>Taking Quizzes</h4><p>On the "Announcements," there is a link to the first quiz. &nbsp;Afterreading the Academic Integrity Policy discussed on the first day, you shouldtake this quiz. &nbsp;All Blackboard quizzes can be taken multiple times, until the deadline.</p><p>You have the option of taking the quizzes on paper,from 8:30 to 8:50 on the day the quiz is due.  If you choose the paper option, you must give 48 hours notice so that a copy of the quiz is printed for you.The on-line and paper quizzes are different but will cover the samematerial.</p><ul><li> If you have a documented learning disability that allows extra time,you must provide written documention at least two days before the quizto have the extra time.  All extended time quizzes are given on paper (not on-line), on the day the quizzes are due (withthe same ending time as others taking the quiz).</li><li> If you are found cheating or accepting help from others on the on-linequizzes, you must take the quizzes on paper.</li></ul><h3>Submitting Written Descriptions</h3>We will use the "Dropbox" option of Blackboard to submit your written descriptionsof problem solutions. &nbsp;The Dropbox is available off the main menu, andhas two options: Add or Send. &nbsp;The Add option stores a file in youraccount (but no one else can see it), while the Send option will send a copyto me. &nbsp;Use the Send option to submit written descriptions.<br><br><h3>Academic Integrity</h3>Quizzes and assignments are open book and open notes, but you may not accepthelp from others while taking your quiz. For assignments, you must acknowledgeall others (including books and websites) with whom you worked with or receivedhelp.  All work must be your own.
