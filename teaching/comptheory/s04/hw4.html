Whenyou write up an answer, make sure <br><ul>  <li>your name is on top of the first page,&nbsp;</li>  <li>include the problem number (and page numbers, if relevant),</li>  <li>state the problem clearly written out (to make it easier to use for studying), and</li>  <li>use complete sentences.<br>  </li></ul><h3>Proofs</h3>Like writing a paper, you need to present a convincing argumentthat is concise and easy to read. &nbsp;The last part of Chapter 0 focuseson how to find proofs and how to write them down. &nbsp;Some general rulesto follow:<br><ul>  <li>State what you're trying to prove, and if appropriate, the type ofproof (i.e. proof by induction, proof by contradiction, etc.). &nbsp;Whileneither of these is required, it makes it much easier for the reader to understandand follow what you're saying.</li>  <li>Use complete sentences in your proofs. &nbsp;On the chalkboard, it'sfine to just write down the main ideas, but when writing up problems formally,you must use proper English and full sentences. &nbsp;Again, this is to makeit easier to read and understand in the future.</li>  <li>Beneat. &nbsp;Your proof needs to convince the reader that the mathematicalstatement in question is true. &nbsp;Sloppiness makes it difficult to followthe details of the argument.</li><li>Be concise. &nbsp;While this might seemcontrary to the requirement to use complete sentences, it is possible tobe brief and convey your ideas to the reader. &nbsp;Include enough detailto get your ideas across, but try to avoid tangents and extra comments thatmight confuse the reader.<br>  </li></ul><br><h2>Undergraduate Problems</h2>All students enrolled should complete the following:<br><br><ol>  <li>Problem 0.10</li>  <li>Exercise 1.13a</li>  <li>Exercise 1.13b</li>  <li>Exercise 1.13c<br>  </li>  <li>Exercise 1.14a<br>  </li>  <li>Exercise 1.17a</li>  <li>Exercise 1.17b</li>  <li>Problem 1.23a<br>  </li></ol><br><h2>Graduate Problems</h2>Students enrolled for graduate credit, should complete all the undergraduate problems, as well as:<br><br><ol>  <li>Problem 0.11</li>  <li>Exercise 1.17c<br>  </li>  <li>Exercise 1.18</li>  <li>Exercise 1.23a</li>  <li>Problem 1.23b<br>  </li></ol><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
