<p>
Today's lab will focus on loops and the <tt>random</tt> library in Python.  <br>Software tools needed:  web browser and Python IDLE programming 
environment.

<h3>More on Turtles</h3>

<p>
Last lab, we wrote a program using Turtle graphics:

<p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/f79254b1f6" width="80%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
Click on the &#9658; to run the program.
<ul>
	<li> Each iteration of the loop, <tt>tia</tt>, our turtle, moves forward 150 steps and then turns right 90 degrees.  
	<li> Change the program so that a smaller square is drawn by changing the  steps moved forward to 100.  Run your program to test the change.
	<li> Change the program so that the turtles turns 88 degrees right.  Run your program to test the change.  Run your program to test the change.
	<li> What happens if you change the <tt>range()</tt> to be 10?
	<li> What happens if you change the <tt>range()</tt> to be 100?
</ul>

<p>
The <tt>range()</tt> function generates a sequence of numbers.  For example, 
<tt>range(4)</tt> gives the sequence <tt>0,1,2,3</tt>.  While <tt>range(10)</tt>
gives <tt>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9</tt>.  In general, <tt>range(n)</tt> will give the sequence <tt>0,1,2,...,n-1</tt>.  We will discuss this more over the next couple of sections.

</div>

<div>
<h3>More on Iteration</h3>  

Let's explore a bit more about how <tt>for</tt> loops repeat, or iterate, a set of commands:

<ol>
	<li> <p> Work through <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/IterationSimplifiesourTurtleProgram.html">4.6 Iteration Simplifies our Turtle Program</a>.
	<li>  Let's use the programs with <tt>alex</tt> the turtle to draw a hexagon with different color sides.  The program from the books drew a square:
	<pre>
import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
   alex.color(aColor)
   alex.forward(50)
   alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()	
	</pre>
	<li> To draw a colorful hexagon:
	<ol>
		<li> Open up <tt>idle3</tt> and start a new file ("File > New File" or "&#8984;N").
		<li> Copy in the program above from the textbook.
		<li> Add two more colors to the list in the <tt>for</tt> statement.
		<li> Change the angle that <tt>alex</tt> turns left to be 60.
		<li> Test your program to make sure it works.
		<li> Add your name and a short description to the top and submit at Problem #6.
	</ol>
	
</div>

<div>
<h3>More on <tt>range()</tt></h3>

Our previous use of the <tt>range()</tt> statement generated sequences that always start with 0, but there are many more sequences that can be generated.

<p> First, work through the textbook's section on the <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/TherangeFunction.html">4.7:  The <tt>range</tt> Function</a>.

<p> Next, let's write a program that will print out:
<pre>
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!
</pre>

<p>If we were asked to print the numbers in the other direction, we could do this with the simplest range:
<pre>
for i in range(11):
    print(i)
</pre>
followed by a <tt>print("Blast off!")</tt>.  But we want to print out the numbers, 10, 9, 8, ... , 1.  In the textbook section, they had a very useful command:
<pre>
print(range(10, 0, -1))
</pre>
which printed <tt>[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</tt>.

<p>Let's use that with a <tt>for</tt> loop to print out our countdown:
<pre>
for i in range(10,0,-1):
    print(i)
</pre>

<p>That gives all the pieces for our program!  Now let's put them together and test it:
	<ol>
		<li> Open up <tt>idle3</tt> and start a new file ("File > New File" or "&#8984;N").
		<li> Copy in the <tt>for</tt> loop above.
		<li> Add in the <tt>print</tt> statement that prints "Blast off!"
		<li> Test your program to make sure it works.
		<li> Add your name and a short description to the top and submit at Problem #7.
	</ol>

Here's another example of the <tt>range</tt> function in action.  Try to guess what it will do before clicking on the run (&#9658;) button:


</div>

<div>
<h3>Random Range</h3>

Python has a built-in library for generating random numbers.  To use it, you include at the top of your file:
<pre>
import random
</pre>

The <tt>random</tt> library includes a function that's similar to <tt>range</tt>, called <tt>randrange</tt>.  As with <tt>range</tt>, you can specify the starting, stopping, and step values, and the function <tt>randrange</tt> chooses a number at random in that range.  Some examples:
<ul>
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(5)</tt> returns one of 0,1,2,3,4
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(1,10,2)</tt> returns one of 1,3,5,7,9
	<li> <tt>random.randrange(360)</tt> returns one of 0,1,2,...,359
</ul>

Let's use that last example to have our turtle make a random walk:
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/ab6cddc880" width="80%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
Notice that our turtle turns <tt>a</tt> degrees, where <tt>a</tt> is chosen at random between 0 and 359 degrees.  What if your turtle was in a city and had to stay on a grid of streets (and not ramble through buildings)?  How can you change the <tt>randrange()</tt> to choose only from the numbers:  <tt>0,90,180,270</tt> (submit your answer as Problem #10).

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a quiz on the <tt>for</tt> loops and turtles.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
