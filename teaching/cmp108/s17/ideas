<h3>Using Decisions</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Change shape of point marked depending on type of 311 complaint
	<li> Change size of earthquake based on magnitude of the quake
</ul>

<ul>
	<li> Get a size to change the pensize that's drawing-- need to convert to int (review of last time).
	<li> Get a message to print out on the screen
	<li> Next program:  use stamp() and penup() and mark out points on screen

	<li> Add in debugging here or after functions?
	<li> When functions are introduced, use CMP Lab 7-- does turtles and functions
	<li> Use babyName data with graphing-- matplotlib or seaborn or bokeh?  

</ul>
