<h2>Lab 14<br>
Programming for Data Analysis<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2017<br><br>
</h2>
</div>


<div>

<p>
Today's lab focuses on using statistical models and hypothesis testing in the R programming language.

<h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>

<p>
If it's been a long time since you have seen hypothesis testing, Khan Academy has a very friendly introduction to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample">significance tests of one sample</a>.   If you're in the lab, to be kind to your neighbors, watch with headphones or turn off the sound and read the subtitles.  Below, we're going to compute the Z-statistics and T-statistics, which are in the section on "Tests about a population mean."

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a quiz on functions and loops.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.

<h3>Using R at Home</h3>

To duplicate the setting in the lab, you will need to download 
<ul>
	<li>R</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.xquartz.org">XQuartz</a> for Mac OSX</li>
</ul>
