<h3>More on Looping: Lists</h3>

<p> In <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, we worked through an example from the textbook that changed looped through a list of colors (from <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/IterationSimplifiesourTurtleProgram.html">4.6 Iteration Simplifies our Turtle Program</a>):
	<pre>
import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
   alex.color(aColor)
   alex.forward(50)
   alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()	
	</pre>

<p>What if we wanted more colors?  We can add more to our list:

<pre>for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue", "green", "pink"]:
</pre>

<p>We can also set up the list ahead of time and then just write its name in the for loop:
<pre>
myColors = ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue", "green", "pink"]
for aColor in myColors:
</pre>

<p> Python creates a location in memory that holds the list.  If we want to use the list, we just write its name (in this case, <tt>myColors</tt>).  In Python, the lists are items, separated by commas, and surrounded by square brackets (i.e. "[" and "]").

<p>Add in three more colors to make <tt>tortuga</tt> draw more!

</div>


<div>
<h3>Reading from a File</h3>

<p> We often store data in a file outside the program.  We could store the really long list of colors in a file, and then, we can change the colors in the drawing by just changing the file.  For example:

<p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/013fcc3c8f" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Click on the tabs just below the run button.  The first tab has the Python program.  The next two contain files.  The first is called <tt>colorList</tt> and is used when you start the program.  The second, called <tt>colors2</tt> has the first 50 colors from the HTML color list.  Change the line that opens the file to:
<pre>
infile = open("colors2")
</pre>
and run the program again.  How many lines does the program draw?

<p> Let's look at this program line-by-line:

<ul>
	<li> This is the standard import statement that we include to use turtles:
<pre>
import turtle
</pre>
	<li> Next, we open the file.  The name to the left of the equals sign is the variable containing information about the file (i.e. name, how much we have read, etc.):
<pre>
#Uses a file to store the colors
#First open up the file:
infile = open("colorList")
</pre>
	<li> The next lines set up a turtle and make it turtle-shaped:
<pre>
#Create a turtle, named tortuga:
tortuga = turtle.Turtle()
tortuga.shape("turtle")
</pre>
	
	<li> Now, for our loop, instead of using a <tt>range()</tt> or a list, we are going to take lines from <tt>infile</tt>.  The loop variable, <tt>c</tt>, will first be the first line in the file, then the next line in the file, and continue until we have exhausted the number of lines in the file:
<pre>
#For each color in our file, draw a side that color and then turn 93 degrees:
for c in infile:
  	tortuga.color(c)
  	tortuga.forward(100)
  	tortuga.left(93)

</pre>

	<li> Lastly, when we're done with a file, we should close it:
<pre>
infile.close()
</pre>

</ul>


</div>

<h3>Multiple Items Per Line</h3>

<p>Our program above worked well since there was only one thing per line.  But many files (including data files we will see in later labs) have multiple items
per line.  

<p>
Consider the file that has a color and shape on each line, separated by a comma:
<pre>
blue turtle 
red arrow 
purple classic 
blue circle  
red turtle 
</pre>

<p>
The first item on each line is the color for the turtle and the second is for the shape.  When we read in a line:

<pre>
for line in infile:
</pre>

<p>The variable, <tt>line</tt>, contains <tt>"blue, turtle"</tt>.  To split up a string into pieces, we can use a built-in string function: <tt>split()</tt> that will return a list.  To use <tt>split()</tt>, we need to specify how we want to split up the line.  Common ways to deliminate items are commas, tabs, and spaces.  Here, we used commas, so, we give <tt>split()</tt> the input parameter , ' ':
<pre>
words = line.split(' ')
</pre>

<p>
The variable <tt>words</tt> is a list.  Using the input file above, <tt>line</tt>, contains <tt>"blue turtle"</tt>, so, 
<tt>words</tt> is <tt>["blue", "turtle"]</tt>.  
<tt>words[0]</tt> contains the color (in this case <tt>"blue"</tt>).
<tt>words[1]</tt> contains the shape (in this case <tt>"turtle"</tt>).
Python did the work of finding the comma and breaking down the string into parts that we can use.

<p>
Let's try it!  Copy this file into a Python file:
<pre>
import turtle

#Uses a file to store the colors
#First open up the file:
infile = open("colorShape")

#Create a turtle, named tortuga:
tortuga = turtle.Turtle()
tortuga.shape("turtle")

#For each line in our file, split it in parts, and draw a side that color and shape:
for line in infile:
	words = line.split(' ')
	tortuga.color(words[0])
	tortuga.shape(words[1])
	tortuga.forward(100)
	tortuga.left(93)
</pre>

In the same folder, save the file <a href="colorShape">colorShape</a>.
Try running your program.  Change the contents of the input file (or create a new one) and try again!  Once you've tested your program, submit as Program 18.

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a quiz on <tt>for</tt>-loops and lists.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.

<h3>Using Python on Your Computer</h3>

The Python programming language and IDLE environment are freely available
for many platforms from <a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a> or
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>.  
For this class, we are using <b>Python 3</b>.  Many features of the language
(including the syntax of <tt>print</tt> statements) changed between the second and third
version, so, you must use the Python 3 for submitting programs.
