<h3>Try R Vector Tutorial</h3>

<p>Last lab, we worked through the first chapter of the <a href="http://tryr.codeschool.com/">Try R</a>.  

<p>Today, we will work through <b>Chapter 2: Vectors</b> of <a href="http://tryr.codeschool.com/">Try R</a>.  Work through the entire chapter on vectors, and then try the vector and plotting below.

<h3>Plotting Vector Data</h3>

<p>
Let's try some of the ideas from the <a href="http://tryr.codeschool.com/">Try R</a> tutorial to plot Vector Data.  

<p>
Open up the R console (either via Applications folder or Spotlight).  At the prompt, create a vector of population for the Bronx:
<pre>
	bronxPop <- c(200507,430980,732016,1265258,1394711,1451277,1424815,1471701,1168972,1203789,1332650,1385108)
</pre>
This is the population from 1900, 1910, 1920, ... 2010 that we used in <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6</a>.

<p>What does it look like?  Let's try plotting it:
<pre>
	plot(bronxPop)
</pre>
<p>
It's okay, but we're missing the years.  Let's create another vector with the years.  We have a start of 1900, a stop of 2010, and a step of 10:
<pre>
	years <- c(seq(1900,2010,10))
</pre>
<p>
Check to make sure we have the right numbers by typing it's name at the prompt:
<pre>
	years
</pre>

<p>Now, we can use <tt>years</tt> as the x-axis and <tt>bronxPop</tt> as the y-axis:
<pre>
	plot(years,bronxPop)
</pre>

<p>To make it prettier, let's add in some color:

<pre>
	plot(years,bronxPop,col="red")
</pre>

<p>Let's also try making a barplot:
<pre>
	barplot(bronxPop)
</pre>
<p>The labels are missing.  <tt>barplot()</tt> works a bit differently than <tt>plot</tt> for specifying the labels for the x-axis.  We can either give the labels as a parameter:
<pre>
	barplot(bronxPop, names.arg=c(seq(1900,2010,10)))
</pre>
Or, we can set the names for bronxPop (as in the Try R tutorial) and then use <tt>barPlot</tt>:
<pre>
	names(bronxPop) = c(seq(1900,2010,10))
	barplot(bronxPop)
</pre>
will yield the same plot.

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a quiz on R basics.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.
