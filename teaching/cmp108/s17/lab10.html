<p>
Today's lab introduces the R programming language.  
</div>


<div>
<h3>Getting Started with R</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a> is freely available (see below for downloading on your own computer).  On the lab machines, R has been downloaded and is in the <tt>Applications</tt> folder.  To find it, navigate to <tt>Applications</tt> or use <tt>Spotlight</tt> (the built-in search function-- the magnifying glass icon on the right side of the top menu bar) and type <tt>R</tt>.  
</p>

<p>(Note:  R can also be launched from the terminal window by typing: <tt>R</tt>.)</tt>

<p>
When launched, a window will pop up labeled <tt>R Console</tt>.  This functions much in the same way as the Python Shell.  Let's start by saying hello to the world.  At the console prompt (the &gt; line at the bottom of the window), type:
<pre>
print("Hello World!")
</pre>

The message, <tt>Hello World!</tt> will be printed below the command, just as it did in the Python shell.</p>

<p>Let's try the same command but stretched out over multiple lines:
<pre>
print("Hello
</pre>
When you hit enter, the prompt changes from a <tt>&gt;</tt> to a <tt>+</tt> to let you know that R thinks that more is needed for the command.  Let's finish it with:
<pre>
World")
</pre>

<p>
You can end R commands with a enter/return (as in Python), or with a semi-colon (<tt>;</tt>).


<p>
Let's try some of our other Python programs.  R doesn't have turtles, but it does have loops.

<ul>
	<li>  In shell, use a loop to repeat a message.</li>
	<li>  Variable assignment (note no = sign, but &lt;- instead)
	<li>  Run a program from a file.</li>
	<li>  Accumulator design pattern.</li>
	<li>  Simple counting, mean, standard deviation.</li>
	<li>  Always useful to know:  to quit R, you type:  <tt>q()</tt>
</ul>

Next lab:
<ul>
	<li> vectors
	<li> data frames 
	<li> file I/O?
</ul>

</div>

<h3>In-class Quiz</h3>

During lab, there is a quiz on functions and loops.  The password to access the quiz will be given during lab.

</div>

<div>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>If you finish the lab early, now is a great time to get a head start on the programming problems due early next week.  There's instructors to help you and you already have Python up and running.  The <a href="ps.html">Programming Problem List</a> has problem descriptions, suggested reading, and due dates next to each problem.

</div>

<div>
<h3>Using R at Home</h3>

To duplicate the setting in the lab, you will need to download 
<ul>
	<li>R</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.xquartz.org">XQuartz</a> for Mac OSX</li>
</ul>
