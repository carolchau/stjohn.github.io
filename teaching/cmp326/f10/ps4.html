<h2>Problem Set 4</h2>
<h3>CMP 326: Programming Methods II <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2010<br><br>
</h3>

<p>
This problem set covers material (multidimensional arrays
and arrays in graphics) from Chapter 7 (arrays).
</p>


<p>You should complete <b>150 points</b> worth of programs
(with an additional 15 points extra credit possible). 
</p>

<p>
The first problems in this set rely on a code base
developed by Richard Wicentowski and Tia Newhall from the
Department of Computer at Swarthmore College.  To use
their code, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Download the code from:
<a href="http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/imagemanip/java_staringpt.zip">
http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/imagemanip/java_staringpt.zip</a>.

<li> Import the java files into a new project in Eclipse.

<li> Copy a jpeg file into the project directory in your
workspace (not the src directory but its parent directory).

<li> Before running the program, configure the "Run" to use
your jpeg file.  To do this, open up the "Run Configurations"
option from the "Run" menu.  Choose the tab labeled "Arguments"
and put the name of your file here.

<li> Read the documentation from Swarthmore:<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/imagemanip/">
Overview of their software and useful documentation</a>, and <br>
<a href="http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/imagemanip/javaassn.html">
Specifics about programs below, including demos.</a><br>

</ul>

<li><b>Lighten Photos</b> (5 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that lightens an entire image.<br>
(Hint:  darkening photos was covered in lecture.)</p>

</li>

<li><b>Blue Photo</b> (5 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that shows only the blue component of 
the image.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Negative</b> (10 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that shows only the negative of 
the image.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Flip Vertically</b> (10 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that flips the image vertically.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Gray Scale</b> (15 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that shows the image in grayscale (ie black
and white).</p>
</li>

<li><b>Zoom Upper Left</b> (15 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that zooms in on the upper left quarter
of the picture (note this will look a little fuzzy).</p>
</li>

<li><b>Vertical Scroll</b> (15 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that shows the image scrolls off one edge
of the screen and wraps around to the other side.</p>
</li>


<li><b>Polarize</b> (20 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that shows the image polarized.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Rotate 90 Degrees</b> (20 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that shows the image rotated 90 degrees.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Blur</b> (20 points)

<p>Using the Swarthmore Image Proccessing Package (described above),
add a new button and feature that shows the image blurred.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Magic Wand</b> (10 points)

<p>Problem 6.11 (p 533)
</p>

</li>

<li><b>Tic-Tac-Toe</b> (25 points)

<p>Problem 6.7 (p 532)</p>
</li>



<li><b>Sudoku</b> (35 points)

<p>
Problem 6.10 (p 532)
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>










<!--
P19. Write a class called PuzzlePiece. A puzzle piece will have a label which will be a number between 1 and 15 and the location of the puzzle piece (which will be the coordinates of the upper left corner). Your class should contain three constructors:

    * a default constructor that sets the coordinates to (0,0) and the label to 0,
    * a constructor that has a single argument that is assigned to label and sets the coordinates to (0,0), and
    * a constructor that takes three arguments: the label, the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate (in that order) and sets the values. 

PuzzlePiece should contain a move method:

    public void move(int dx, int dy)

that changes the position by dx units in the x direction and dy units in the y direction. Finally, you should have a draw method:

    public void draw()

that draws a square containing the label, using the object's coordinates for the upper left corner.

Write a second class called Program19 that uses PuzzlePiece and demonstrates its features. Submit this as program 19 using the electronic submission. Please call the file (and the class) Program19. Include an HTML file in the directory called Program19.html that displays your applet.

P20. P6.18, p 287. Submit this as program 20 using the electronic submission. Please call the file (and the class) Program20. Your program should calculate the result to six digits after the decimal point.

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 50 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 5 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
