<h2>Problem Set 2</h2>
<h3>CMP 326: Programming Methods II <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2010<br><br>
</h3>

<p>
This problem set covers review material from Chapters 4-6.
</p>


<p>You should complete <b>100 points</b> worth of programs
(with an additional 10 points extra credit possible). 
</p>
</div>



<div>
<ol>

<li><b>Happy Faces</b> (5 points)

<p>
Modify the program from Listing 4.9 (available from the
textbook or on Blackboard as <tt>MultipleFaces</tt> in 
the source code zip file) to show 5 rows of 5 faces.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Space Counter</b> (5 points)

<p>
Exercise 4.9 (p 229):  Write a program that counts the 
number of spaces in a string entered by the user.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Reverse Words</b> (10 points)

<p>Problem 4.9 (p 232):  For all the following words, if you move the
first letter to the end of the word, and then spell it backwards, you
will get the original word:
<pre>
banana dresser grammar potato revive uneven assess
</pre>
Write a program that reads a word and determines whether it has
this property.  Continue reading and testing words until you 
encounter the word <tt>quit</tt>.  Treat uppercase letters as
lowercase letters.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Star Triangle</b> (10 points)

<p>Problem 4.13 (p 233): 
Write a program that asks the user to enter the size of a 
triangle (an integer from 1 to 50).  Display the triangle by
writing lines of asterisks.  The first line will have one
asterisk, the next two, and so on, with each line having
ome more asterisk than the previous line, up to the number entered by the 
user.  On the next line write one fewer asterisk and continue by decreasing the 
number of asterisk until only one is displayed.
<i>Hint:</i>  Use nested <tt>for</tt> loops; the outside
loop controls the number of lines to write, and the inside
loop controls the number of astericsks to display on a line.
For example, if the user enters 3, the output would be:
<pre>
*
**
***
**
*
</pre>

</p>
</li>

<li><b>Purchase</b> (10 points)

<p> Problem 5.6 (p 333):  Write a program that uses the 
<tt>Purchase</tt> class in Listing 5.11 (also available on Blackboard)
to set the following prices:

<pre>
Oranges: 10 for $2.99
Eggs: 12 for $1.69
Apples: 3 for $1.00
Watermelons: $4.39 each
Bagels: 6 for $3.50
</pre>
Then calculate the cost of each of the following five items and
the total bill:
<pre>
2 dozen oranges
3 dozen eggs
20 apples
2 watermelons
1 dozen bagels
</pre>

</p>
</li>

<li><b>Automobile Class</b> (10 points)

<p> Implement the <tt>Automobile</tt> class discussed
at the beginning of Chapter 5 and in the powerpoint
presentation for that chapter.  Your class should have:
<pre>
Data (instance variables):
  amount of fuel
  speed
  licence plate
  
Methods (actions):
  accelerate
    How: Press on gas pedal.
  decelerate
    How: Presee on brake pedal.
</pre>
Include a driver program that instantiates several 
objects of type <tt>Automobile</tt> and demonstrates
the class.
</p>
</li>


<li><b>MotorBoat Class</b> (15 points)

<p>Exercise 5.7 (p 329): Implement a class <tt>MotorBoat</tt>
that represents motorboats.  A motorboat has attributes
for:

<ul>
  <li>The capacity of the fuel tank</li>
  <li>The amount of fuel in the tank</li>
  <li>The maximum speed of the boat</li>
  <li>The current speed of the boat</li>
  <li>The efficiency of the boat's motor</li>
  <li>The distance traveled</li>

</ul>
The class has methods to
<ul>
  <li>Change the speed of the boat</li>
  <li>Operate the boat for an amount of time at the current speed</li>
  <li>Refuel the boat with some amount of fuel</li>
  <li>Return the amount of fuel in the tank</li>
  <li>Return the distance traveled so far</li>
</ul>

If the boat has efficiency <i>e</i>, the amount of fuel used
when traveling at a speed <i>s</i> for time <i>t</i> is 
<i>e x s^2 x t</i>.  The distance traveled in that time is <i>s x t</i>.
</p>
<p>
Include a driver program that instantiates several 
objects of type <tt>MotorBoat</tt> and demonstrates
the class.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>PersonAddress Class</b> (15 points)

<p>Exercise 5.8 (p 330):  Implement a class <tt>PersonAddress</tt>
that represents an entry in an address book.  Its attributes are:
<ul>
  <li>The first name of the person</li>
  <li>The last name of the person</li>
  <li>The email address of the person</li>
  <li>The telephone number of the person</li>
</ul>
It will have methods to
<ul>
  <li>Access each attribute</li>
  <li>Change the email address</li>
  <li>Change the telephone number</li>
  <li>Test whether two instances are equal based solely on name</li>
</ul>
Include a driver program that instantiates several 
objects of type <tt>PersonAddress</tt> and demonstrates
the class.

</p>
</li>



<li><b>Pet Class</b> (10 points)

<p> Problem 6.5 (p 434):  Using the class <tt>Pet</tt>
from Listing 6.1 (and also available on Blackboard), write
a program to read data for five pets and display the 
following data:  name of smallest pet, name of largest
pet, name of oldest pet, name of youngest pet, average
weight of the five pets, and average age of the five
pets.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Species Class</b> (15 points)

<p>
Problem 6.2 (p 434): Modfify the definition of the class <tt>Species</tt> in
Listing 5.17 (and also available on Blackboard) by removing
the method<tt>setSpecies()</tt> and adding the following
methods:
<ul>
	<li>Five constructors:  one for each instance variable,
	one with three parameters for the three instance variables,
	and a default constructor.  Be sure that each constructor
	sets all of the instance variables.</li>
	<li>Four methods named <tt>set</tt> that can reset values:
	one is the same as the method <tt>setSpecies()</tt> in Listing
	5.16, and the other three each rest one of the instance
	variables.</li>
</ul> Then write a test program to test all the methods you
have added.  
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Red, White and Blue</b> (10 points)

<p>
Problem 6.15 (p 438):  Write the code for an applet that
has three buttons labeled, <tt>Red</tt>, <tt>White</tt>, and
<tt>Blue</tt>.  When a button is clicked, the background of
the applet changes to the color named on the button.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Light</b> (10 points)

<p>
Problem 6.16 (p 438):  Create an applet <tt>Light</tt> that
simulates a simple light.  Create one button labeled <tt>On/Off</tt>.
As you click this button, the background color will change between
<tt>DARK_GRAY</tt> and <tt>YELLOW</tt>.
</p>
</li>



<!--
P19. Write a class called PuzzlePiece. A puzzle piece will have a label which will be a number between 1 and 15 and the location of the puzzle piece (which will be the coordinates of the upper left corner). Your class should contain three constructors:

    * a default constructor that sets the coordinates to (0,0) and the label to 0,
    * a constructor that has a single argument that is assigned to label and sets the coordinates to (0,0), and
    * a constructor that takes three arguments: the label, the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate (in that order) and sets the values. 

PuzzlePiece should contain a move method:

    public void move(int dx, int dy)

that changes the position by dx units in the x direction and dy units in the y direction. Finally, you should have a draw method:

    public void draw()

that draws a square containing the label, using the object's coordinates for the upper left corner.

Write a second class called Program19 that uses PuzzlePiece and demonstrates its features. Submit this as program 19 using the electronic submission. Please call the file (and the class) Program19. Include an HTML file in the directory called Program19.html that displays your applet.

P20. P6.18, p 287. Submit this as program 20 using the electronic submission. Please call the file (and the class) Program20. Your program should calculate the result to six digits after the decimal point.

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 50 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 5 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
