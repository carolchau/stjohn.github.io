<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
The department has the following policies for
the lab:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> There is no eating or drinking in the lab. </li>
  <li> Due to restricted class sizes, children are not allowed in the
computer labs. </li>
  <li> Do not waste paper-- only print files that directly relate to
the class. </li>
  <li> Do not enter the lab until the scheduled class time. If the lab
is open before class time, it is because another class is using it or
for maintenance. </li>
  <li> Always log out and turn off the monitor when you leave the lab. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
First, turn on the computer-- the button is
in the front. The monitor should also come on, if it doesn't,
the button for it is also in the front. It will take a few moments for
the computer to get started. Some machines in the department are set up
as dual boot.  If yours is, you will then see a RedHat logo
on the left hand side of the screen, and the words <tt>linux</tt>
and <tt>win</tt> in a white box on the right. Choose <tt>win </tt>and
hit return. These machines are "dual-boot," with both Linux
and Windows. By choosing <tt>win</tt>, the machine will boot up
under the Windows operating system.

<li><b>Snowman</b> (5 points)

<p>
Problem 1.6 (p 39):  Write a program similar to Listing 1.2 that
displays a picture of a snowman.  
<br><i>Hint:</i>  Draw three circles, 
one above the other.  Make the circles progressively smaller from 
bottom to top.  Make the top circle a happy face.
</p>
</li>


<li><b>Vertical Display</b> (5 points)

<p>Problem 2.4 (p 116): Write a program that reads a four-digit
integer, such as 1998, and then display it, one digit per line, 
like so:</p>
<pre>
1
9
9
8
</pre>
</li>


<li><b>Hate/Love Program</b> (10 points)

<p>Problem 2.7 (p 116): Write a program that reads a line of
text and then displays the line, ut with the first occurrence
of <i>hate</i> changed to <i>love</i>.  For example, a possible 
sample diaglog might be:</p>
<pre>
Enter a line of text.
I hate you.
I have rephrased that line to read:
I love you.
</pre>
</li>


<li><b>Making Change</b> (10 points)

<p>Problem 2.10 (p 117): Write a program that determines the
change to be dispensed from a vending machine,  An item in the
machine can cost between 25 cents and a dollar, in 5-cent
increments (25, 30, 35, ..., 90, 95, or 100), and machine accepts only
a single dollar bill to pay for the item.  For example, a 
possible dialogue with the user migh be:
<pre>
Enter price of item
(from 25 cents to a dollar, in 5-cent increments): 45

You bought an item for 45 cents and gave me a dollar,
so you change is
2 quarters,
0 dimes, and
1 nickel.
</pre></p>
</li>

<li><b>Binary Converter</b> (15 points)

<p>Problem 2.11 (p 117): Write a program that reads a four-bit
binary number from the keyboard as a string and then converts
it into decimal.  For example, if the input is <tt>1100</tt>,
the output should be 12.  <br>
<i>Hint:</i> Break the string into substrings and then convert
each substring to a value for a single bit.  If the bits are a,
b, c, and d, the decimal equivalent is 8a + 4b+ 2c + d.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Date Converter</b> (10 points)

<p>Problem 2.13 (p 118): Write a rpogram that reads a string
for a date in the format <i>month / day / year></i> and
displays it in the format <i>day . month . year</i>, which
is a typical format used in Europe.  For example, if the input
is 06/17/08, the output should be 17.06.08.  Your program 
should use <tt>JOptionPane</tt> for input and output.</p>
</li>


<li><b>Order</b> (10 points)

<p>Problem 3.2 (p 172): Write a program to read in three
nonnegative integers from the keyboard.  Display the 
integers in increasing order.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Guessing Game</b> (10 points)

<p>Write a guessing game program that asks the user to 
guess your secret number.  If the guess is too high, write
a message saying so and ask them to guess again.  
Similarly, if the guess is too low, write a message
saying so and ask them to guess again.  If they guess
correctly, congratulate them and end the program.</p>
</li>



</ol>

</div>





<div>
<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 50 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 5 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
