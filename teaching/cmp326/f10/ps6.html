<!--
P19. Write a class called PuzzlePiece. A puzzle piece will have a label which will be a number between 1 and 15 and the location of the puzzle piece (which will be the coordinates of the upper left corner). Your class should contain three constructors:

    * a default constructor that sets the coordinates to (0,0) and the label to 0,
    * a constructor that has a single argument that is assigned to label and sets the coordinates to (0,0), and
    * a constructor that takes three arguments: the label, the x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate (in that order) and sets the values. 

PuzzlePiece should contain a move method:

    public void move(int dx, int dy)

that changes the position by dx units in the x direction and dy units in the y direction. Finally, you should have a draw method:

    public void draw()

that draws a square containing the label, using the object's coordinates for the upper left corner.

Write a second class called Program19 that uses PuzzlePiece and demonstrates its features. Submit this as program 19 using the electronic submission. Please call the file (and the class) Program19. Include an HTML file in the directory called Program19.html that displays your applet.

P20. P6.18, p 287. Submit this as program 20 using the electronic submission. Please call the file (and the class) Program20. Your program should calculate the result to six digits after the decimal point.

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 50 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 5 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
