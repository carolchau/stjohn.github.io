<h2>Problem Set 9</h2>
<h3>CMP 326: Programming Methods II <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2010<br><br>
</h3>

<p>
This problem set covers material from Chapter 11 (Recursion).
</p>


<p>You should complete <b>50 points</b> worth of programs
(with an additional 5 points extra credit possible). 
</p>
</div>



<div>
<ol>

<li><b>Blinking</b> (10 points)

<p>Write a graphical program that every second changes the
screen from red to green.  The program should be very simple,
and there is no need for any user
interface (ie buttons or text fields).  </b>

<li><b>Pop Up Window</b> (15 points)

<p>Write a graphical program that has a main window and an
additional window that pops up a window for 5 seconds and
disappears.  Use any of the graphical programs from earlier
in the semester as the base and see the counting primes 
program as a way to time the length that something occurs.</p>

<li><b>Time Out</b> (15 points)

<p>Write a program that times out if the user does not enter
anything in 20 seconds. <br>
(Hint:  use the counting primes program as a base).

<li><b>Rolling Ball</b> (15 points)

<p>Write a graphical program where a ball "rolls" across the
screen.<br>
(Hint:  every tenth of a second refresh the screen with a
circle in a new position to give the appearance of moving
across the screen.)

<li><b>Poker</b> (40 points)

<p>Implement the poker program from the Wellesley College page:

<h3>Submitting Your Problem Set</h3>
<p>
You should submit 50 points worth of problems for grading by
the deadline (see class schedule for date).  To submit a program, 
you need to demonstrate (during office hours or lab) your program
and explain how it works.
</p>

<p>
If you complete extra problems by the deadline, up to 5 additional 
points can be counted towards extra credit.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
