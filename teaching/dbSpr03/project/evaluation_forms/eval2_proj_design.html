If there's significant changes from your        initial E/R diagram, include a redrawn version.  Rembember, you        should have at least 5 entity sets and 5 relations.  Make sure to	mark any one-one and many-one relations, as well as weak entity	sets, subclasses, and keys.  Include as notes on your diagram	any assumptions made for your database.&nbsp;<ul>      <li><b>Included one-one and many-one relations:</b><br clear="all">        <b> &nbsp;</b></li>      <li><b>Included keys and weak entity sets:</b><br clear="all">        <b> &nbsp;</b></li>      <li><b>Comments:<br clear="all">&nbsp;      </b></li>    </ul></li><li> <b>Conversion to Relations:</b>  Convert your E/R diagram 	to a relational schema.
