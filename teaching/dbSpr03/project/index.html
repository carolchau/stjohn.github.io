The projects for this semester will beimplemented in a combination of SQL and Java.  The project is worth15% of your final grade.<p>As described in <a href="../lab1.html">Lab 1</a>, you will bebuilding a substantial database application for a real-world scenarioof your choosing. You will design a relational schema for thedatabase, and you will create an actual database using a relationaldatabase management system.  You will populate the database withsample data, write interactive queries and modifications on thedatabase, and develop user-friendly tools for manipulating thedatabase. For ideas on possible databases, see the book's webpage.</p><p>Your first step is to identify the domain you would like to managewith your database, and to construct an entity-relationship diagramfor the data. Pick an application that you will enjoy working with,since you'll be stuck with it for the rest of the semester.</p><p>Try to pick an application that is relatively substantial, but nottoo enormous. For example, when expressed in the entity-relationshipmodel, you might want your design to have in the range of five or soentity sets, and a similar number of relationships. Note that thisis a ballpark figure only! You should certainly include differentkinds of relationships (e.g., many-one, many-many) and differentkinds of data (strings, integers, etc.), but your application is notrequired to use advanced features, such as subclassing, multiwayrelationships, or weak entity sets, if they are not appropriatefor your application.</p><p></p><h3><a name="Initial_Design"></a>Initial Design</h3><font color="red">Target Date: 20 February in lab.</font><p>Please use <b>complete sentences</b>, and type (or write neatly) thefollowing:</p><ul>    <li> Describe the database application you propose to work    with throughout the course. Your description should be brief    and relatively informal. If there are any unique or particularly    difficult aspects of your proposed application, please point    them out. Your description will be graded only on suitability    and conciseness.    </li><li> Specify an entity-relationship diagram for your    proposed database. Don't forget to underline key    attributes and include arrowheads indicating the multiplicity of    relationships. If there are weak entity sets, indicate them by    double lines, as described in class.</li></ul><h3><a name="Design_Specification"></a>Design Specification</h3> <font color="red">Target Date: 6 March in lab.</font><p>For this part of the project, you need:</p><ul>    <li> An <b>E/R diagram</b> describing your database application.  	Include the one from the first part of the project, addressing         any changes suggested.  If there's significant changes from your        initial E/R diagram, include a redrawn version.  Rembember, you        should have at least 5 entity sets and 5 relations.  Make sure to	mark any one-one and many-one relations, as well as weak entity	sets, subclasses, and keys.  Include as notes on your diagram	any assumptions made for your database.      </li><li> <b>Conversion to Relations:</b>  Convert your E/R diagram 	to a relational schema.  Include keys for each relation 	and a list of <b>functional dependencies for each of your	relations</b>.    </li><li> <b>Normal Forms:</b> Are your relations in normal form for	BCNF, 3NF or 4NF?  Include a brief explanation about which	normal forms your relations obey.  If they violate some 	normal form, explain why (remember, sometimes there's cases	where being in normal form might not be best for the design).</li></ul><h3><a name="Initial_Webpage"></a>Initial Webpage</h3> <font color="red">Target Date: 13 March in lab.</font><p>For this part of the project, you need to design the initial webpage foryour project. &nbsp;In the future, the webpage will be used to access yourdatabase. &nbsp;For now, your webpage should have:</p><ul><li>The name of your project,&nbsp;</li><li>your name, and<br>  </li>  <li>      a short description of the project (2-3 sentences that describe your database--     these can be taken from your original design).<br>  </li></ul><p>You should title the file <tt>index.html</tt> and post your webpage in your <tt>public_html </tt>directory on <b>comet</b>.<br></p><h3><a name="SQL_Schema_and_Data_Modification"></a>SQL Schema and Database Creation</h3> <font color="red">Target Date: 20 March in lab.</font><p>You must turn in, on paper, the SQLcommands used (as well as any programs used).

<h3>Populating your Database</h3>

<font color="red">Due 3 April in lab.
</font>
<p>
For this part of the project, you must turn, on paper, the SQL
commands and java programs used.  You also must demonstrate that
your database has the properties listed below, during lab.
</p>


<p>
For this part of the project, you need:
</p>


<ul>

<li> An <b>SQL schema</b> that creates the relations in your
	database, including definitions of primary keys and 
	references.  This can be done either by loading a file
	into <tt>psql</tt> or by running a java program.
    </li><li> <b>To Populate your database:</b> with at least 10 tuples
	per table and a total of at 100 entries.  Use a java program
	to insert the values into the table, or to format a file
	of SQL commands and load those via <tt>psql</tt>.
    </li><li> <b>Data Selection Queries:</b> You need at least 3 selection
	queries that are <b>natural</b> for your database application.
	For example, if you have a database about films, a natural
	queries would be all the films by a given studio, or the longest
	film each actor appeared in.
	At least one of the queries must include a subquery.  At least
	one must use more than one table.  These queries must be
	embedded in java programs.
    </li><li> <b>Data Modification Statements:</b> You need at least 2
	data modification statements that make sense for your 
	database application.  For example, if you have a database
	for employees, you could have an update statement that gives
	every employee a 5% raise.  These statements must be
	embedded in  java programs.
</li>
</ul>
<!--
<h3>Triggers, Constraints, and Views</h3> 

<h3>Views</h3> 
<font color=red>Due 6 December in lab.
</font>
<p>
Create two natural views for your database.  These should incorporate
some common query a user would ask of your database.  For example, if
your database is for employees, you might want a view that consists of
the names and addresses of all employees that live in the Bronx.

<h3>Java Interface</h3> 
<font color=red>Due 13 December in lab.
</font>

<p>
Write a java interface for a user to interact with your database.  A
user should be able to click on a button that executes one of your 
queries from above and displays the results to the screen (using a 
scrolling text subwindow would be one way to do this).  You should have
a second button that displays one of your views.

<p>
Extra credit points (5% each) will be given, if in addition to above,
your interface:
<ul>
    <li> allows the user to insert a tuple into one of your tables,
	using button, radio buttons, and text windows (i.e. the user
	should do the minimal amount of typing).  For example, if your
	database is for a university, you should allow a user to 
	enroll in a class, by typing their social security number, and
	then choosing the department and course number from menus or
	buttons.
    <li> allows the user to delete a tuple from your database by 
	specifying only the key.  For example, if your database is 
	an employee database, include the ability for the user to
	delete employees by typing only their employee id number.
</ul>

<h3>Turning in the Final Project</h3>

During the last lab, you need to show Prof. St. John how each part
of your lab works.  Once you have done that, you should collect
all the files for the lab into a bundle (called a <tt>tarball</tt>)
and mail it to 
<a href="mailto:stjohn@lehman.cuny.edu">stjohn@lehman.cuny.edu</a>.

<p>
To make bundle a directory, called <tt>myproject</tt>, you type 
at the command line:
<pre>
    tar cfv myproject.tar myproject
</pre>
This will create a file called <tt>myproject.tar</tt> that consists
of all the files in the directory <tt>myproject</tt>.  To mail it,
you can use Netscape mail, or you type at the command line:
<pre>
    mail stjohn < myproject.tar
</pre>

<p>
Since all accounts will disappear 14 January, you should transfer 
any files you wish to keep to another machine.  To do this, make 
a tarball of the directories and then mail it (or you can use 
the file transfer program, <tt>ftp</tt>) to another machine.
