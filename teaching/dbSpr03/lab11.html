How would you remove deleting privilegeson <tt>companies</tt> from your neighbor?<!--
<h3>Transactions</h3>

--></p><h3>Final Comments</h3>If you have extra time, use it to work on your project.<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut down yourcomputer.  First, you should quit all applications.  Then,go to the <tt>K</tt> menu in the bottom left hand corner andselect <tt>Log Out</tt>.  Choose the <tt>Shut Down</tt> option,and shut off the monitor when you're done.</p><p>Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer and totake any personal belongings.  It is difficult to get backinto the lab later (since it's locked when not in use), so,it's worth making sure you haven't forgotten anything.</p><p></p><br><br><br></body></html>
