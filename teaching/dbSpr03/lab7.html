You can find the API's for JDBC at Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jdbc/index.html">webpage</a>.To use the JDBC interface, you first have to make sure that your javaprograms can find the java archive that contains the file (that is,set the path to find the .jar file).  Then, you need to implicitly loadthe driver, before issuing SQL commands.<h3>Setting up your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt></h3>First, locate the java archive file for JDBC, by typing:<pre>    locate jdbc | grep jar<br></pre>What's the full name of the .jar file?  What is the complete pathto the file?<p>Next, we need to include the .jar in the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>,or places to look for the libraries or archives used by the program.To make sure that the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> is set whenever you log on, you can set it in the <tt>.bash_profile</tt>, which is executed whenever you open a new terminal window. To do this, edit the <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and add the lines:</p><pre>    CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/pgsql/jdbc6.5-1.2.jar:.<br>    export CLASSPATH<br></pre>The `.' at the end of the CLASSPATH says to also look in the currentdirectory for classes.  The <tt>export</tt> statement means that theenvironment variable will continue to exist after the file has finishedexecuting.<p>To immediately put the changes in to effect that you entered in your <tt>.bash_profile</tt>, type at the command line:</p><pre>    source .bash_profile<br></pre>To check that it was successful, print the environment variables,searching (or "grepping") for the ones that include the word PATH:<pre>    printenv | grep PATH<br></pre>You should see two different path variables-- one for locating executable programs and one for loading classes into java.  <h3>Loading the <tt>driver</tt> class</h3>The file <a href="TestDB.java">TestDB.java</a> isa simple java program that includes the <tt>import</tt> statementand java command for loading the necessary driver.  Compile it,and make sure it runs (if it does, it will say "Test successful").<p>Whenever you use SQL statements in your java program, you will haveto include these two commands.  Note that the <tt>forName</tt>method could throw a <tt>ClassNotFoundException</tt> and must be caught and handled.</p><h3>Connecting to the Database</h3>Before you can issue query and update commands, you first mustsay which database you would like to use.  This is equivalent togiving the name of the database when you launch <tt>psql</tt>(for example, <tt>psql testDB</tt>).  To connect to a database, you need to specify the name of the database (prefaced by the interface names: "jdbc:postgresql:"), your username, and thepassword (since we have not yet used password protection on thedatabases, we use the word "pass" for this argument).  For example,to connect to the database <tt>myDB</tt>, as user <tt>testPerson</tt>,with no password, you would have the following command:<pre>    Connection db = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql:myDB", <br>                                                "testPerson", "pass");<br></pre>Note that this method, as well as the ones in the next section,can throw <tt>SQLExceptions</tt> that must be caught and handled.<p>Modify the java program from the previous section to connect to the database you created for Lab 2.</p><h3>Query Statements in Java</h3>To query the database, you first need a <tt>Statement</tt> object(you can reuse it for later statements) and an object of type<tt>ResultSet</tt> to hold the results of your query.  For example,the following would print out the company names from your database:<pre>    Statement st = db.createStatement();<br>    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select co_name from companies");<br>    System.out.println("Company Name");<br>    while(rs.next()) {<br>       System.out.println(rs.getString(1));<br>    }<br>    rs.close();<br>    st.close();<br></pre>These statements could throw an <tt>SQLException</tt> that must becaught and handled.<p>Modify your java program to print out the company names from thedatabase.</p><h3>Update Statements in Java</h3>To update the database (or execute any statement that doesn't returnresults), you use the <tt>executeUpdate()</tt> method of the <tt>Statement</tt> class.  For example, if you wanted to create a new table, <tt>t</tt> with two attributes, one an integer andone for time, you use the following statement:<pre>    st.executeUpdate("create table t(id int4, date timestamp);");<br></pre>For example, to insert new values into the table, you coulduse the following statements:<pre>   st.executeUpdate("insert into t values(3, now());");<br>   st.executeUpdate("insert into t values(2, now());");<br></pre>These statements could throw an <tt>SQLException</tt> that must becaught and handled.<h3>Java Programs for this Lab</h3> At the command line, create a database for this lab.  <p>Write a java program that creates 2 tables:</p><pre>     Employees(ID, Name, Address, StartYear, StopYear, Salary)<br>     Colleges(SchoolName, StudentName)<br></pre>and adds in several employees and keeps track of the schoolsthey attended. &nbsp;Type these by hand. &nbsp;In a future lab, we will load in employees automatically, using a Java progra.<p>Write another program that prints out the number of years each employee was employed (that is, the difference between <tt>StartYear</tt> and<tt>StopYear</tt>).</p><h3>Final Comments</h3>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut down yourcomputer.  First, you should quit all applications.  Then,go to the <tt>K</tt> menu in the bottom left hand corner andselect <tt>Log Out</tt>.  Choose the <tt>Shut Down</tt> option,and shut off the monitor when you're done.<p>Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer and totake any personal belongings.  It is difficult to get backinto the lab later (since it's locked when not in use), so,it's worth making sure you haven't forgotten anything.</p><br><br></body></html>
