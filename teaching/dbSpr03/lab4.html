So, the output has only a     unique, or single copy of each line from the original file.</li><li><pre>ls | sort</pre>     What does the above command do?  How does the output change if you add the "-u"      option?</li><li><pre>sort lab2data.txt | wc -l</pre>     What does the above command do?  How does the output change if you add the "-u"      option?</li></ul><h3>Full-Relation Operators</h3>In Lab 2, we created a database that stored information about companies,products, and orders. &nbsp;We then populated the database with informationabout orders and products from 9 companies. &nbsp;Today's lab will use thesame database and focus on using the full-relation operators discussed inSection 6.4.<br><br>Note: &nbsp;this lab follows from Lab 2. &nbsp;If you haven't completed Lab2 or forgotten the queries you wrote for Lab 2, you will find this lab mucheasier if you know write all the queries from Lab 2.<br><br>For today's lab,<br><ol>  <li>List all orders that <b>not</b> been paid for.<br clear="all">    <i>(Hint: look at the data file and figure out what is the value of the ord_paid field if the order hasn't been paid for.)</i></li>  <li>List all orders that have<b></b> been delivered.</li>  <li>List the orders that have been delivered, but not paid for. &nbsp;<br clear="all">    <i>(Hint: &nbsp;combine the two queries above using a full-relation operation.)</i></li>  <li>Find all dates on which an order was placed. &nbsp;List each date exactly once.</li>  <li>Find each order and its quantity that exceeds the average order quantity for all orders. <br clear="all">    <i>(Hint: Use the ideas in Query #3 from Lab 2.) </i><br>  </li></ol><h3><br></h3><p></p><h3>Final Comments</h3>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut down yourcomputer.  First, you should quit all applications.  Then,go to the <tt>K</tt> menu in the bottom left hand corner andselect <tt>Log Out</tt>.  Choose the <tt>Shut Down</tt> option,and shut off the monitor when you're done.<p>Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer and totake any personal belongings.  It is difficult to get backinto the lab later (since it's locked when not in use), so,it's worth making sure you haven't forgotten anything.</p><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
