Lab ideas: 

sorting m&m's by color

count lines until hit obstacle-- return home and 
report (need to introduce timers)

Lab 5:
can do in teams of two if you'd like, since building takes a while...
lab on gearing, ratios, pulleys-- lift something really heavy?
what to use as weights (lego bricks, wheels)?  Can you drag 
your robot box?  How far?
How fast can you make a car go?  
Make a claw/arm (see lego book).  can you make it grasp an object?
can it pick up a lego piece?


Lab 6: 

	Need white sheets of paper, big markers, more lego pieces,
	lego people?


	Can do in teams of two if you'd like
	Customize robots, so we can tell them apart as they (there's
		spare parts in hallway)
	try the robotag program from the webpage with a partner on
		the test ovals from your lego box
	Simple communication: beam a number to another robot (0-7)
		and it should beep that many times and display it
		as the value for output port b.
		(random number generator?)
	Next, have your robots run to the end of the course, get a
		trophy (a lego person) and bring it back.
		You may mark the start and finish line on the paper
		in whatever color you would like.  You can also set
		the trophies anywhere past the finish line that works
		for your robot design.  And you can set up walls at
		the end (but not along the sides).
	After dropping the trophy, tell the next person in the team
		that you're back so they can go.  Make sure you tell
		the robot who comes immediately after you and don't
		signal the wrong robot accidently.

<h1>Laboratory Exercise 6</h1>
<h2>Cluster V: Computers and Robots<br>
COSMOS Program, UC Davis<br>
19 July 2001</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Communication</h3>

Today's lab focuses on communication.  The first set of programs
beams a number to another robot, who responds by beeping.  
If you have your robot with a bumper and light sensor, you should
also try the <a href="lmstorms/RoboTag.nqc">RoboTag.nqc</a>
program.


<p><b>Design requirements:</b>  This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C.  Further, each 
motor is attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.).  When using the light sensor, it is wired to 
sensor port 2.  The touch sensor is wired to sensor port 1
and is attached to a bumper).


<h3>Sending Messages</h3>

Download the <a href="beep.nqc">beep.nqc</a> program to your
robot.  Try sending it a message via the command line.  For
example:
<pre>
nqc -msg 4
</pre>
Next, write a program called <tt>sendMessage.nqc</tt> that 
will send a number between 1 and 7 to another robot.  Test
your program with another robot.  One robot will be running
the <tt>beep.nqc</tt> program and the other will be running
<tt>sendMessage.nqc</tt>.

<p>
Use the random number generator to generate a number between
1 and 7 to be sent.  Display that number on the view screen
as the value for <tt>OUT_B</tt> (since this output port isn't
being used, you can set it's power level to the number you
would like displayed).

<p>
Modify the <tt>beep.nqc</tt> program to display the incoming
message as the value for <tt>OUT_B</tt>, as well as beeping
that number of times.

<p>
Next, write a program that will turn left if it receives
an even number as a message and turns right if it receives
an odd number.


<h3>RoboTag</h3>

If you have your robot with a bumper and light sensor, you should
also try the <a href="lmstorms/RoboTag.nqc">RoboTag.nqc</a>
program.

<h3>Projects</h3>

You should use the remaining lab time to work on your project.
