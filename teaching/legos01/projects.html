<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
<h2>Cluster V: Computers and Robots<br>
COSMOS Program, UC Davis<br>
13 July 2001</h2>

<hr>

Each cluster has a final project that will be part of the
closing event on Saturday, 4 August.  For our cluster, you
have the choice of doing a computational physics project
or building a robot and accompanying programs.

<p>
If you choose to build a robot: 
<ul>
    <li> Your project can have up to 5 programs 
	(the total size of all loaded programs cannot exceed 6K).  
    <li> Different lego configurations for different programs 
	are possible, but you must be able to convert from one 
	to another <b>quickly</b>.   
    <li> Designs need to be submitted during the second week, so,
	we can arrange for special parts (if needed).  
</ul>

Here's some possible ideas:
<ul>
    <li> a robot with an arm (see Chapter 5 of the <b>Unofficial Guide</b>)
    <li> <a href="http://www.enteract.com/~dbaum/lego/creations/sortet.html">a 
	brick sorter</a>
    <li> a jukebox that plays songs on request
    <li> a robot that navigates a maze using the light sensor and bumpers
    <li> <a href="http://www.enteract.com/~dbaum/lego/creations/garbage.html">a 
	garbage truck</a>
    <li> <a href="http://www.wordsmithdigital.com/mindstorms/trambot.htm">an 
	aerial tram</a>
    <li> a robot that 
	<a href="http://www.geocities.com/~marioferrari/ttt.html">plays
	tic-tac-toe</a>
    <li> a team of robots that cooperates in completing a task (like playing
	tag, relay race, moving an object, etc.)
    <li> <a href="http://unite.com.au/~u11235a/lego/clock/index.html">a 
	clock</a>
    <li> <a href="http://unite.com.au/~u11235a/lego/plotter/plotter.nqc">a
	plotter</a>
    <li> <a href="http://www.mop.no/~simen/legoscan.htm">a
	scanner</a>
</ul>
