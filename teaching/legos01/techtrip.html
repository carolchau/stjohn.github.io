Answer the questions below about the special programs and the Innovation and
Communication Galleries:
</li>
    <ol>
	<li> (Robot dogs): How many different sensors does each dog
		have?<br><br>
	<li> (Robot dogs): Sensors are an example of "input" devices, and
		motors are an example of "output" devices.  What other
		output devices do the robot dogs have?<br><br>
	<li> (PB&J): What was the most difficult step of making a sandwich
		to describe to the robot?<br><br>
	<li> (PB&J): An <b>algorithm</b> is a step-by-step set of 
		instructions to accomplish a task.  Does the algorithm for 
		making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich change if you 
		give the directions in Spanish instead of English?  Why 
		or why not?<br><br>
	<li> (Innovation Gallery): Explore the Bike Design Studio.  What 
		material would you select?  Why? <br><br>
	<li> (Innovation Gallery): Have a "map" made of your head.  How is
		this different from a regular photograph?<br><br>
	<li> (Communication Gallery): How is information transmitted on a
		fiber optics network?  What is the "fiber" made of? <br><br>
	<li> (Communication Gallery): Besides fiber optics networks, how
		else can information be transmitted?<br><br>
