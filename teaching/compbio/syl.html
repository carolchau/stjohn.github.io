Prerequisities:&nbsp;CMP 338.&nbsp; CMP 337 or 300 level mathematics course suggested.<br>    <br clear="all">This introductory course in computational biology will be aimed at upperdivision undergraduate or beginning masteres students in computer.&nbsp;No biological background is assumed.&nbsp; Biology students with an interestin bioinformatics may also take the course, but the emphasis will be on thecomputation side: writing programs to efficiently use and extend currentbioinformatics tools.<br>    <br>Topics to include: introduction to molecular biology and bioinformatics,using perl and unix for bioinfomatics applications, multiple sequence alignmentand dynamic programming (e.g. Smith-Waterman), assessment of<br>sequence alignments, biological databases and search tools (e.g. FASTA andBLAST), and phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms (e.g. Maximum Parsimonyand Neighbor Joining, using PAUP* and phylip).<br>If time allows, the prediction of protein secondary structure and bioinformatics visualization tools will also be covered.<br>    <br>Programming:&nbsp; This course will include regular programming assignments,mostly in the perl scripting language, and a large comprehensive project.&nbsp;No knowledge of perl is assumed, but previous programming experienceis<br>required.&nbsp;</li><li> <b>Textbook:</b> <i>Developing Bioinformatics Computer Skills</i>,		by Gibas &amp; Jambeck, O'Reilly. 	</li><li> <b>Programming Environment:</b>A large fraction of bioinformatics programs run on Unix systems, so, we willdo the majority of our work on Unix systems, including the computationalclusters used for teaching at CUNY.&nbsp; 	</li><li> <b>Grading:</b> The grading for the course will be based on:		<ul>			<li> Quizzes: 30%			</li><li> Programs: 25%			</li><li> Project: 25%			</li><li>Project Presentation: 10%			</li><li> Project Poster: 10%		</li></ul>	</li><li> <b>Assignments:</b> Homework assignments are posted on the class website.		These are not to be turned in but are the subject of		the quizzes.  More information about the quizzes can be		found <a href="quiz1.html">here</a>.		<br>		Programming assignments will are also posted on the webpage. &nbsp;Theseare to be turned in via the "dropbox" in the Blackboard system.&nbsp;  Ifyou wish to improve a grade  		on any program, you may resubmit it for grading.		<br>		Full credit will only be given for those programs that		run correctly and have good documentation and		programming style. &nbsp;<br clear="all">To encourage participation in student presentations and poster sessions, there will be quizzes on all the projects. &nbsp;<br clear="all">All quizzes and programming assignments must be completed by Thursday, 18 December.</li><li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the		overall design of the programs and homework.  However, for 		specific		programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.		<br>		You are responsible for knowing and following 		Lehman's 		<a href="acadPol.pdf">academic integrity code</a>		in the 		<a href="http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/programs/undergraduate.html">Undergraduate Bulletin</a>.		<br>		All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice		President of Student Affairs.  	</li><li> <b>Computer Accounts:</b> You will be assigned a computer 		account on the Linux machines for work relating to this		course only.  More information about the computer accounts		and Linux machines will be available later in the course.</li></ul> <hr>This website for this class is located at: <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/compbio/">http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/compbio/</a><hr><br><br><br></body></html>
