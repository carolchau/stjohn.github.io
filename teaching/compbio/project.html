These projects will in general be more work than the explanatoryprojects due to their open ended nature. &nbsp;If you are interested in thistype of project, you should discuss your and your groups interest with Prof.St. John to find a project that fits with your interest and strengths.<br><h3>Initial Plan</h3><font color="#ff0000">(Target date of&nbsp; 23 October)</font><br><br>This should be a short email stating the name of your group members, thetype of project you're interested in, and the broad area in which you wouldlike to work. &nbsp;<br><h3>Initial Design</h3><font color="#ff0000">(Target date of 30 October)</font><br><br>Your initial design should be a page long description of what's involvedin your project, estimates on how long it will take and the resources needed.&nbsp;You should include a list of possible references (see the end of thetextbook for a good starting point) and any software or hardware resourcesyou're planning to use. &nbsp;<br><br>The initial design can be submitted by email as plain text, or an attachment of a text or pdf file.<br><br><h3>Progress Report 1</h3><font color="#ff0000">(Target date of 13 November)</font><br><br>This should include a rough draft of your presentation and an assessmentof how much of your initial design you have completed. &nbsp;With the thisfirst progress report, you should also include an abstract (short description)of your presentation as well as a title. &nbsp;These should be viewed asadvertisements for your talk and give the reader an overview of what youwill cover in 5 sentences or less. &nbsp;You should also have a short bibliography(3 or more primary sources, not including the textbook) of references youhave used (or plan to use) in your presentation.<br><br><h3>Progress Report 2</h3><font color="#ff0000">(Target date of 20 November)</font><br><br>This should include the status of your project, a revised draft of your presentation,as well as any audio/visual requests for the presentation.<br><br><h3>Presentations</h3><font color="#ff0000">(In class from 25 November to 9 December, organized by topic)</font><br><br>Your grade is based on several criteria:<br><ul>  <li>Did you clearly present the topic, why it is relevant to computational biology?</li>  <li>Were you presentation slides clear and easy to read?</li>  <li>Was your oral presentation easy to follow for the audience?</li>  <li>Did you cover the material in depth?</li>  <li>Did you include at least 3 references on which your presentation is based?</li></ul>Here's the <a href="project_eval.html">evaluation form</a> used for the presentation.<br><h3>Extra Credit Questions</h3><font color="#ff0000">(DUE DATE of 5 December)</font><br><br>Extra credit will be given for up to 5 questions based on your presentation.&nbsp;Some or all of the provided questions will be used in the Blackboardquizzes. &nbsp;The questions will be graded based on originality and depthof coverage of the material. You may use any of the question formats providedin Blackboard (true/false, multiple choice, matching, multiple answer). Toget the full credit, your questions should cover different aspects of yourpresentation, and different levels of difficulty.<br><h3>Poster Session</h3><font color="#ff0000">(In class on 11 December)</font><br><br>This is an opportunity for your fellow students to ask questions about yourpresentation. &nbsp;Your poster can consist of a printed version of yourpresentation. &nbsp;Make sure to include in large lettering the name of membersof your group, the topic name, and your abstract.<br><h3>Project Quizzes</h3><font color="#ff0000">(All quizzes on posters must be completed by 18 December)</font><br><br>Quizzes will be available from 10 December to 18 December on Blackboard.&nbsp;All work for this course must be submitted by 18 December. &nbsp;Anymaterial on comet that you wish to keep should be copied off by the 18th.<br><br><br></body></html>
