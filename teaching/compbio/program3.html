Before writing the program,look at several examples and identify common properties. &nbsp;A few minutesof familiarizing yourself with the format ahead of time will same much timein the programming. &nbsp;For parsing the input, you might find the push()and pop() functions applied to a list helpful. See for a description of the format: <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html">http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html</a></li></ul><br><br><br><br></body></html>
