Do five of the following six problems.  Write each answer on a separate
piece of paper.


\begin{enumerate}
%Define the following terms:
	\item Define the following terms:
     	   \begin{enumerate}
		\item finite state automaton
		\item regular language
		\item Given a finite set $\Sigma$, define $\Sigma^*$
		\item Given a string $s$, define $|s|$
		\item Given string $s_1, s_2$, define $s_1 \circ s_2$
	   \end{enumerate}
%What is wrong with this proof?
   	\item Find the error in the following proof that $2=1$.\\
		Consider the equation $a=b$.  Multiply both sides by $a$ to obtain $a^2 = ab$.
		Subtract $b^2$ from both sides to get $a^2-b^2 = ab-b^2$.  Now factor each 
		side, $(a+b)(a-b) = b(a-b)$, and divide each side by $(a-b)$, to get $a+b=b$.
		Finally, let $a$ and $b$ equal 1, which shows $2=1$.
%Build DFA's
   	\item Give the state diagrams of NFAs recognizing the following languages.  In all
	    cases the alphabet is $\Sigma = \{a,b,c,d,\ldots,x,y,z\}$, the 26 lowercase letters.
	    \begin{enumerate}
		\item $\{w \mid w \mbox{ contains the substring $yellow$}\}$
		\item $\{w \mid w \mbox{ is of even length or ends with the substring $bye$}\}$
	    \end{enumerate}
%Show closure under one of the regular operators
   	\item Prove that the class of regular languages is closed under the star operator.
%Show the language is not regular
   	\item Let $\Sigma = \{0,1,+,=\}$.   Prove that the following language is not regular:
		$$
			ADD = \{ x=y+z \mid x,y,z \mbox{ are binary integers, and x is the sum of y and z} \}
		$$
%Given context-free grammar, what is the lang, make PDA
   	\item Give context-free grammars generating the following languages.  The language
		is $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$.
	  \begin{enumerate}
		\item $\{w \mid \mbox{$w$ starts and ends with the same symbol}\}$
		\item the complement of the language $\{a^n b^n \mid n\geq 0\}$
	  \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
