was it the machineyou were trying to build?)-- and proving that some other operator was regularinstead of the one on your version of the exam. &nbsp;If the idea was therebut muddled by notation, only 5 points were deducted.<br><br><b>Question 5:</b> &nbsp;Prove a language is not regular.<br><br>When using the Pumping Lemma, you cannot choose the length of the y givenby the Pumping Lemma for a given string. &nbsp;The lemma is weaker, it onlysays that some y exists that satisfies the conditions of the lemma for eachstring s longer than the pumping length. &nbsp;1/2 the points were deductedfor choosing a fixed y, instead of considering all the possibilities thatit could be.<br><br>The blue exam asked to show that the <b>complement </b>of {0^n1^n &nbsp;|n &gt;= 0} is not regular. &nbsp;Half of the points were awarded if you onlyshowed the language (and not it's complement) is regular. &nbsp;This questioncan be approached in a number of ways. &nbsp;The easiest would be to showthe language is not regular, and then note that the class of regular languagesis closed under complementation.  You could also look at the language intwo parts: those words that have more 0's than 1's and those that have more1's than 0's. &nbsp;Or, you can do this directly using the Pumping Lemmaby choosing 0^p1^{p+p!} and pumping with (1+p!/j) where j is the length ofy.<br><br>The pink exam asked similar question to the blue and can be solved in the same way.<br><br>The yellow exam asked about the language ADD from the homework. &nbsp;Mostmistakes were forgetting that "=" is just another symbol in the language.&nbsp;If you choose s = "1^p = 1^p + 0", then the rest follows as before.<br><b><br>Question 6:</b> &nbsp;Give CFGs<br><br>This was the question most likely to be skipped. &nbsp;All of these are fromthe book and homework. &nbsp;Part a) for each version was a simple CFG, andpart b) more complicated. &nbsp;The most common mistake was to draw DFA'sinstead of writing out grammars.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
