2002</h2><hr><br><h2>Grading</h2>The exam was graded in the same style as the comprehensiveexam in June. &nbsp;Each question was worth 20 points. &nbsp;The overal scorewas the sum of the best five question scores. &nbsp;You can not score over100%.<br><br><h4>Regrading:</h4>If you would like your exam regraded, please attach anote on the front of the exam. &nbsp;Your note should explain which questionsyou would like regraded and why. &nbsp;Please use complete sentences. &nbsp;<b>Do not write</b>on the exam itself. &nbsp;If you do so, your exam will not be considered.&nbsp;You must turn the exam in for regrading by Friday, 13 December.<br><ul>  </ul><h4>Scores:</h4>After each exam was graded, the average of thedifferent exams were calculated. &nbsp;The scores were than normalized tomake up for any differences in difficulty between the different versionsof exams. &nbsp;The average across all exams is 85 with standard deviation 13.<br><br><table cellpadding="2"

taking the exam in June, each question must be answered on a separate piece of paper (actually, separate "blue book").</li>  <li>If you do better on the final, it will replace the either (or both) midterm exams.</li>  <li>Writing down the answer of another color exam not only gives you no credit but is cheating.<br>  </li></ul><b><br>Question by question breakdown:<br><br><br></b><b>Question 1:</b> &nbsp;Define basic terms and build a simple Turing Machine.<br><br>Most everyone had no problems. &nbsp;Note that to double a number inbinary notation, you only need to "add an zero" to the end of the string.&nbsp;A similar question to this has appeared frequently on the exam offeredin June. &nbsp;See for example, June 2002, #2. &nbsp;On the June exam, thisquestion is considered easy, so, mistakes on this are graded harshly. &nbsp;Thesame was done for this exam.<br><br><b>Question 2:</b> &nbsp;Show sets are countable/uncountable.<br><br>These came straight from the homework and the book. &nbsp;Again, similarquestions appear frequently on the June exam and, since <br>considered easy, mistakes on this are graded harshly.<br><br><b>Question 3:</b> &nbsp;Show the Halting Problem plus some other set (varied by exam) is undecidable. <br><br>While each version of the exam had different questions, they were all variationson a theme. &nbsp;Part a) was show the Halting Problem <br>undecidable. &nbsp;Few showed this by the diagonalization method directly,but almost everyone did prove the statement. &nbsp;Part b) was slightly harderand asked you to show some set was undecidable. &nbsp;One way to do this,you reduce the halting set to the given set. &nbsp;Some folks built the TMdirectly, others used the s-m-n theorem. &nbsp;Quoting Rice's Theorem wasgiven credit, but you should note that you will not get credit &nbsp;forsuch an answer on the June Exam.<br><br><br><b>Question 4:</b> &nbsp;Easy questions about Turing recognizable and decidable sets.<br><br>The most common mistake was writing down the answer to a different exam.<br><br><b>Question 5:</b> &nbsp;State either Rice's Theorem and PCP.<br><br>Most got Rice's Theorem but forgot the proof. &nbsp;For PCP, recall that you allow repetitions of the tiles.<br><b><br>Question 6:</b> &nbsp;Harder questions about Turing recognizable and decidable.<br><br>Hardest question was on the yellow and pink exams. &nbsp;A good choice for J is 0A x 1B.<br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
