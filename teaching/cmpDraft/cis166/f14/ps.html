<h3>General Notes</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description,
		contain a <tt>main()</tt> function and an invocation of the main at the end of the file:
		For example:
	<pre>
#Name: Herbert H. Lehman
#Date: September 4, 2013
#This program prints: hello world

def main():
	print("Hello world")
	
main()
	</pre>
	<li> About one of every five submitted programs will be chosen, at random, for complete grading.	
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Extra credit will be awarded for the programs that are chosen for complete grading 
	that are submitted early. If a graded 
	program is submitted more than 12 hours early, 1 extra credit point will be awarded. For 
	graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early, 2 extra credit points will be awarded. 
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using Blackboard, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, you must do your own typing.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>

		For example, if your first name is <tt>Eric</tt>, you would use <tt>Euros</tt>.  From
		the table above, we have that one dollar is worth 0.77 euros.
		You should begin the program by printing out your name.
		On each line, your program should write the number of dollars and the corresponding
		number of your currency.  For example:
		<pre>
Eric's converting program
		
Dollars:    Euros:
1           0.77
2           1.53
3           2.3
4           3.07
5           3.84
		</pre>
		Your program should print the information for 1, 2, ..., 10 dollars.  You do 
		not need to worry about formatting (we will talk about that more in Chapter 5), 
		but you do need to calculate all 10 entries.  <br>
		<i>Hint:  modify the program from the <a href="../../cmp230/f14/lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.</i>
		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 18 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for time in years and prints the number of years and days (assume that there are 365 days in a year). For example, if the user entered, 1000, your program would output, <tt>2 years 270 days</tt>. Note that you should use "years" and "days" for all inputs (even in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).

		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 19 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for the number of doughnuts they have ordered, and prints the number of dozens of doughnuts and single doughnuts.
		For example, if
		the user entered, 26, your program would output, <tt>2 dozen and 2 doughnuts</tt>.
		Note that you should use "dozen" and "doughnuts" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).  



	<li> <b>Due Date: 22 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for time in days and prints the number of 
		years and days (assume that it is not a leap year and there are 365 days in a year).  
		For example, if
		the user entered, 400, your program would output, <tt>1 years 35 days</tt>.
		Note that you should use "years" and "days" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).

	<li> <b>Due Date: 23 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Built into python is a module for simple drawing, called Turtle graphics 
		(see <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>).  To 
		use the Turtle graphics module, you must import it, just like with the math module.
		Some basic turtle commands are:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>left(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>right(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>forward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
			<li> <tt>backward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
		</ul>
		
		The following draws a 4-sided figure or square:
		<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(4):
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(90)        #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()		
		</pre>
		
		Modify this program to draw a <b>6-sided figure or hexagon</b>.  Make sure to 
		include the standard introductory comments at the beginning of your program
		as well as to <b>change the name of the turtle to your name.</b>


	<li> <b>Due Date: 29 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Modify the turtle program to draw two squares to the screen.  
		Make sure to 
		include the standard introductory comments at the beginning of your program
		as well as to <b>change the name of the turtle to your name.</b>
	
	<li> <b>Due Date: 30 September</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Implement the following piece of pseudocode (i.e. directions that look very similar to code) as a complete program using turtle graphics:
<pre>
    Repeat 45 times:
        Walk forward 100 steps
        Turn right 92 degrees
</pre>
		Your output should look similar to:

	<li> <b>Due Date: 1 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>	
		Write a program to calculate how much money you would have if saved $10 a month 
		in your change jar.  Since you are not using a bank, no interest is paid on 
		your savings.  Your program should ask the user for the number of days and display
		the amount of money for each day.  The starting amount of money is $0.
		Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter the number of days:  4
Month 1:  $10
Month 2:  $20
Month 3:  $30
Month 4:  $40
		</pre>	


	<li> <b>Due Date: 2 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for an amount and calculates the total after applying the New York City tax rate of 8.875 percent.  For example, if the user enters 1000, your program should print $1088.75 (do not worry about formatting the number to have only two digits after the decimal-- we will discuss how to do that in Chapter 5).

	<li> <b>Due Date: 3 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		<i>Problem #5, p 76:</i>  The Konditorei coffee shop sells coffee at $10.50 a pound plus the cost of shipping.  Each order ships for $0.86 per pound + $1.50 fixed cost overhead.  Write a program that asks the user for the number of pounds of
		coffee and calculate the cost of an order.
		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 6 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that will calculate the cost per ride on an unlimited ride 
		MetroCard.  Your program should ask the user for two numbers:  the cost of 
		the card, and the number of rides.  The program should then print the cost
		per each ride.  For example, if the user paid $30 for the card and took 25 
		trips, your program should print out the cost per ride of $1.20.

	



	<li> <b>Due Date: 7 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that will calculate the average miles per hour for a trip.  
		Your program should ask the user for two numbers:  the miles traveled, and 
		the number of hours the trip took.  The program should then print the average
		miles per hour.  For example, if the user traveled 10 miles in 2 hours, your
		program should print out that they averaged 5 miles per hour.

	<li> <b>Due Date: 8 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	Write a program that asks the user for a string and then prints it out in all upper case and then all lower case.  
	Here is a sample run of the program: 
	<pre>Please enter a string:  Look behind, look here, look ahead
You entered (shouting):  LOOK BEHIND, LOOK HERE, LOOK AHEAD
But better (whispering): look behind, look here, look ahead
</pre>		

	<li> <b>Due Date: 9 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for a line of text and prints the number
		of characters entered:

<pre>
Please enter a line:  I love python
You entered 13 characters.
</pre>
		<p>Note: Use <tt>characters</tt> in your output, even if it is not grammatically correct (i.e. "1 characters").  We will discuss how to fix this by making decisions in Chapter 7.

<a id="set5"></a>
<hr>

	<li> 
		<b>Due Date: 10 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that measures strings in terms of the length of your name.  For
		example, if your first name is "Kate", you would use the length of the string 
		"Kate" which is 4.  If your name is "Daniel", you would use the length 6.
		
		<p>Your program should print out <b>your name</b> to the screen and then ask the user
		to enter a string.  You should then print out how long the string is in terms of
		the length of your name (that is, the length of the user's string divided by
		your length).  For example,
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Kate"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 2.25 Kate's long.
		</pre>
	While, if your name was Daniel, your program would look like:
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Daniel"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 1.8333 Daniel's long.
		</pre>		



			
	<li> <b>Due Date: 13 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Modify the <tt>encode.py</tt> program from <a href="../../cmp230/f14/lab5.html">Lab 5</a>
		to use an offset entered by the user to encrypt the message.  The program in the
		lab encrypts each character by the character 1 place ahead in the alphabet.  Your
		program should ask the user for the offset and encrypt their string by replacing
		each character by one that is <i>offset</i> places ahead in the alphabet.	
		
		<p>
		A sample of Caesar cipher disk (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher</a>) with an offset of 13 (that is, every letter in plain text goes to one 13 letters to its right):<br>
		<img src="../../cmp230/f14/Ciphrdsk.gif"> 


	<li> <b>Due Date: 14 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		<i>Problem #9, p 163:</i>  Write a program that prints out the number of words in 
		a sentence entered by the user. <br>
		<i>Hint:  how can you tell when a word ends?  Count those and adjust slightly
		to get a count on the number of words.</i>

	<li> <b>Due Date: 15 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		<i>Problem #10, p 163:</i>  Write a program that prints out the average word length in 
		a sentence entered by the user. 

	<li> <b>Due Date: 16 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for a list of prices of items purchased and 
		prints out each price and the total, formatted nicely. Here is a 
		sample run of the program:
		<pre>
Please enter the prices:  2.34, .99, 100, 81.05, 90
		
Your receipt:
         2.34
         0.99
       100.00
        81.05
        90.00
----------------
Total: 274.38	</pre>
		<i>Hint:  use the <tt>format()</tt> statement discussed in Chapter 5.</i>

<a id="set6"></a>
<hr>


	<li> <b>Due Date: 20 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for a name of a file and then prints to 
		the screen the number of characters and lines in the file.
		Hint:  see <a href="../../cmp230/f14/lab6.html">Lab 6.</a>

	<li> <b>Due Date: 21 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file and a line length.
		Your program should then "wrap" all lines that are longer than line length,
		and print the result on the screen.
		For example, if the file contains:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789012345
This line has more than 20 characters.
This one has less 
And this one has lots, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		and the user entered the length of 20, all lines longer than 20 would 
		be wrapped to the next line:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789
012345	
This line has more t
han 20 characters.
This one has less 
And this one has lot
s, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		Hint:  break the problem in to parts:  first write a program that will print lines
		from a file to the screen (see <a href="../../cmp230/f14/lab6.html">Lab 6<a>).  Then modify 
		your initial program to only print lines up to the length entered.  And, to finish
		the program, then add in the code that prints lines that are longer than the length 
		entered.
		

	<li> <b>Due Date: 23 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for a file containing a list of items to be completed
		and a name for an output file.  Your program should then write the list, with item numbers
		to the output file.  For example, if the input file is:
<pre>
Finish my python homework.
Buy milk.
Do laundry.
Update webpage.
</pre>
		Then the output file would be:
<pre>
1.  Finish my python homework.
2.  Buy milk.
3.  Do laundry.
4.  Update webpage.
</pre>
	
	<li> <b>Due Date: 27 October</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>	
	
		Write a program that asks for a list of names and a list of cities, as well as
		a file.  Your program should use the file as a template to generate letters 
		customized with the names and cities entered.  You should 
		generate a letter for each name/address pair on the inputted lists.
		The customized letters should replace
		every the <tt>**INSERT NAME HERE**</tt> with the name and <tt>**INSERT ADDRESS HERE**</tt>
		with the address.

		<p>
		For example, if the file <tt>inputTemplate.txt</tt> contained:

		<pre>
						New York, New York
						11 October 2013
	
**INSERT NAME HERE**
**INSERT ADDRESS HERE**

Dear **INSERT NAME HERE**,

Thank you for your service to New York City, and,
in particular, to the education of its residents.
Those in **INSERT ADDRESS HERE** appreciate it!

Best wishes to **INSERT NAME HERE** and your family,

	--CUNY

	<li> <b>Due Date: 2 December</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 8</b><br>
		The program <a href="../../cmp230/f14/turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="http://learn.code.org/s/1/level/23">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
		<ul>
			<li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward
			<li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
			<li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
			<li> '^':  lifts the pen
			<li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		</ul>
		For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.
		
		<p>
		Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
		<ul>
			<li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards
			<li> 'r':  change the pen color to red			
			<li> 'g':  change the pen color to green
			<li> 'b':  change the pen color to blue
		</ul>		

		<p>Submit your modified program (including a comment at the top of the program with your name).
		
		<p><i>Hint: See <a href="lab12.html">Lab 12</a>.</i>


	<li> <b>Due Date: 8 December</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 8</b><br>

	Write a program that asks the user to enter a number between 1900 and 2014.  If they 
	enter a number out of range, print a message that the number is out of range and prompt
	them again for a number between 1900 and 2014.  When the user enters a number in range, print
	the number to the screen and end the program.


	<li> <b>Due Date: 9 December</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 8</b><br>


		Write a program that reads in a text file, infile.txt, and prints out all the lines in the file to the screen until it encounters a line with fewer than 5 characters. Once it finds a short line (one with fewer than 4 characters), the program stops.	

	<li> <b>Due Date: 10 December</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 8</b><br>

		Modify the  program from <a href="lab13.html">Lab 13</a> that processes name files from the Social Security Admininstration.  Your program should ask the user for a file name and a minimum name length and then
		print out the first name that is at least that length and then stop.
		
		<p>For example, the input file <a href="NY.TXT">NY.TXT</a> starts out:
		<pre>
 NYF1910Mary,1922
 NYF1910Helen,1290
 NYF1910Rose,990
 NYF1910Anna,951
 NYF1910Margaret,926
 NYF1910Dorothy,897
 NYF1910Ruth,712
 NYF1910Lillian,648
 NYF1910Florence,604
 NYF1910Frances,589
 NYF1910Elizabeth,579
 NYF1910Mildred,562
		</pre>
		Here a two sample runs of the program:
		<pre>
Please enter the file name: NY.txt
Please enter the minimum length: 5
The first name with length 5 or more is:  Helen
Thank you for using my name length searching program!
		</pre>
		and
		<pre>
Please enter the file name: NY.txt
Please enter the minimum length: 9
The first name with length 9 or more is:  Elizabeth
Thank you for using my name length searching program!		
		</pre>		
		
		<p><i>Hint:  The program from the lab looks at every line of the file, but this program is a bit different in that it stops after it finds a long enough name.  To do this, you need to change the loop to an indefinite loop (i.e. a <tt>while</tt> loop) or figure out how to <tt>break</tt> out of a definite loop (i.e. the <tt>for</tt> loop).</i>

		


		<li> <b>Due Date: 11 December</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 13</b><br>
		
		Modify the selectionSort (from Chapter 13 of the book or Zelle's website)
		to sort lists of numbers backwards.  For example, the list, 
		<tt>[125,4,145,59,168,34,14,42]</tt>, should be sorted as:
		<tt>[168,145,125,59,42,34,14,4]</tt>.
		
		<p>
		In your submitted file, include a <tt>main()</tt> function that demonstrates
		that the sort algorithm works.
