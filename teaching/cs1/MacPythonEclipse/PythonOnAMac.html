<span style="font-size: 120%;">
<p>Macs come with Python installed, <b>BUT</b>, it is not the current version (it is version 2) and will not do for this class.  You must install the most recent version, version 3.</p>

<p>Your Mac must have operating system Mac OS X 10.3 through 10.6.  Then use your browser to go to

<a href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/.</a>

Click on <i>Python 3.1.2 Mac OS X Installer Disk Image</i>.  This will create a disk image, visible on your desktop.  Make sure you click on the right thing, and not on Python 2.7, which is the older version of Python.  Open the disk image and click on <i>Python.mpkg</i> which will start the installer.  Install on your hard drive, and then eject the disk image.</p>

<p>You should now have a folder called Python 3.1 in your Applications folder.  Open it and click on Update Shell Profile.command.</p>

<p>At this point you should have Python 3 installed.  You can now do any of the following, and you should try them all.
<ol>
<li>You can run Python from a terminal window.  In your Applications Folder, inside the Utilities Folder, is Terminal.app.  You should add it to your dock.  When you start the Terminal application you can type commands.  Typing <i>Python3</i> starts python going, and then you can interact with it.  Notice the "3".  If you just type <i>Python</i> you will get the older Python 2, which you don't want.</li>
<li>From the terminal window you can type <i>idle3</i> which will start the environment we will be using for the first part of the course.  Once again, if you forget the "3" and just type <i>idle</i>, you will get something that uses the older version of python.</li>
<li>In your Applications Folder there is a Python 3.1 Folder.  In this there is IDLE.app.  You should add this to your dock.  Double clicking on it is another, and convenient, way to start the idle environment.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Later in the semester we will be moving to Eclipse, and now is as good a time as any to install it.  For instructions, <a href="EclipseOnAMac.html">click here</a>.</p>
