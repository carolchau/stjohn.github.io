<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.4, p 278.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.11, p 279.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.12, p 279.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.21, p 281.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.22, p 281.
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>
<ol>

    <dt><b>P13.</b> Exercise P5.15, p 227.  Submit this as program 13 
		using the electronic submission.  Please call the
		file (and the class) Program13.  
<p>		
    <dt><b>P14.</b> Write a program to simulate the walk of a drunkard
    		in a square street grid.  Draw a grid of 21 streets
		horizontally and 21 streets vertically (discussed in 
		lecture, 25 September).  Place a simulated person at
		the center of the grid (i.e. at (0,0)), denoted by
		a point.  For 100 times, have the simulated person
		randomly pick a direction (east, west, north, south),
		move one block in that direction, and redraw the
		dot.  Circle the starting and stopping positions of
		the walk with a circle of radius one quarter.<p>
		Prompt the user if they would like to try again.  If
		their answer starts with 'y' or 'Y', clear the window
		and simulate another random walk.  If the user enters
		anything else, thank them for playing.<p>
		For example,
		<p>
		<applet code = "RandomWalk.class"
			height = 300
			weight = 300
			alt = "(Your browswer does not run Java applets.)">
			</applet>
		<p>
    		Submit this as program 14 using the electronic submission.  
		Please call the file (and the class) Program14.  
		Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program14.html
		that displays your applet.

		<p><b>Extra credit</b> if you also highlight the path that
			the simulated person walks.  Since we're working
			in black and white, one way to do this would be
			to draw a line slightly below and above the path,
			making the path appear as a wider line.
