    <dt><b>P29.</b> (Daily Appointments) 
	Write a class called
        <tt>Daily</tt> to keep track of daily appointments.
        Your class should contain a list of appointments (you
        may assume that there will be no more than 50 appointments
        per day) and a counter that keeps track of the number of
        appointments.  Your class should contain a default constructor
        that initializes the array and sets the counter to 0.
        <p>
        Your class should also contain the following methods:
        <ul>
            <li> <tt>public void addAppointment(Appointment a)</tt>
                that inserts an appointment into the list.  The list
                should be sorted by beginning time of appointments.

            <li> <tt>public Appointment getAppointment(int n) </tt>
                that returns the <tt>n</tt>th appointment on the list.  If
                <tt>n</tt> is larger than the number of appointments,
                this function should return <tt>null</tt>.

            <li> <tt>public void print()</tt> that prints all
                the appointments.

            <li> <tt>public int search(String s)</tt> that finds the
                first appointment that contains <tt>s</tt> as part
                of its description and returns its index in the list.
        </ul>

        <p>
        Your main program should ask the user to enter an appointment
        as many appointments as they wish.  Then, it should give them
        the choice of adding an appointment, finding an appointment
        by substring or number, or printing.  For example:
	<pre>> javac Program29
Please enter the beginning time for an appointment
(year month day hour min second):
1999 5 10 15 30 0

Please enter the ending time for an appointment
(year month day hour min second):
1999 5 10 17 30 0

Please enter a description of the appointment:
Final Exam!

Do you want to enter another appointment? (y/n)
y
	
Please enter the beginning time for an appointment
(year month day hour min second):
1999 5 10 4 0 0

Please enter the ending time for an appointment
(year month day hour min second):
1999 5 10 15 0 0

Please enter a description of the appointment:
Study for exam
	
Do you want to enter another appointment? (y/n)
n

Choose one of the following options:
  1) Add another appointment
  2) Find an appointment by substring
  3) Find an appointment by appointment number
  4) Print all appointments
  5) Quit
Your choice:
2

Enter the substring:
Final

The appointment is: Final Exam!
Beginning Time: 1999 5 10 15 30 0
Ending Time: 1999 5 10 17 30 0
	
Choose one of the following options:
  1) Add another appointment
  2) Find an appointment by substring
  3) Find an appointment by appointment number
  4) Print all appointments
  5) Quit
Your choice:
5

Thank you for using the daily appointments program!
</pre>

        <p>
        You should include comments for each of your functions that can be
        used by javadoc to generate documentation (see notes from class
        or the book for more details about using javadoc).  
        This program should be console-based.

        Submit this as program 29 using the electronic submission.
        Please call the file (and the class) Program29.

    <dt><b>P30.</b> (Sun Sorting Demo) 
On their Applets page, Sun has a <a href=
        "http://www.java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.0/demo/
	SortDemo/index.html">sorting demonstration</a>.
        Copy the following files into your directory from the Sun
        site:
        <ul>
                <li><a href=
                "http://www.java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.0/demo/SortDemo/SortItem
.java">The applet.</a>

                <li><a href=
                "http://www.java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.0/demo/SortDemo/SortAlgo
rithm.java">The "generic"
                        sorting algorithm.</a>

                <li><a href=
                "http://www.java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.0/demo/SortDemo/BubbleSo
rtAlgorithm.java">The Bubble
                        Sort algorithm.</a>

                <li><a href=
                "http://www.java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.0/demo/SortDemo/index.ht
ml">The HTML file</a> (view the source of this).

        </ul>
        Make two new subclasses of the <tt>SortAlgorithm</tt>
        class for selection sort and merge sort (see
        the book for the algorithms, or, for merge sort, you may use
        P25 of <a href="hw8.html">Homework 8</a>).
        Make a new HTML file (based on the one above) that displays
        selection sort, merge sort, and bubble sort.
        Note that you do not modify SortAlgorithm.  Instead
        you create new classes, similar to <tt>BubbleSortAlgorithm</tt>,
        called <tt>SelectionSortAlgorithm</tt> and <tt>MergeSortAlgorithm</tt>.

        <p>
        Submit this as program 30
        using the electronic submission.  Please call the
        file (and the class) Program30.
        Include an HTML file in the directory called Program30.html
        that displays your applet.


<p>
    <dt><b>P31.</b> (Binary Search Tree) 
	Write a program that reads in words from a file
	called <tt><a href="dictionary.dat">dictionary.dat</a></tt>
	and inserts each word into a binary search tree.  Your
	program should then print out the words in alphabetical
	order.  Words may occur multiple times in the input 
	file.  However, they should only be placed in the binary
	search tree the first time they occur.

	<p>
        Submit this as program 31
        using the electronic submission.  Please call the
        file (and the class) Program31.

	<p>
	<b>Extra Credit:</b> Extra credit will be given if, along
	with the sorted list you also print out the height of
	the binary search tree used.  For example, for 
	<tt>dictionary.dat</tt>, the resulting binary search
	tree would be:

	<img src="bst.jpg">

	<p>
	The height of this tree is 5.

	<p>
	<b>Hints:</b>
	<ul>
	    <li> Modify the program <tt>Etree.java</tt> (from
	    Chapter 13) to work with words instead of employees.
	    The programs from the book can be found in:
	    <pre>
	    /usr/local/javas/ccj
	    </pre>

	    <li> Since we allow duplicate words, your inserting 
	    method must also check if the word is already in the binary
	    search tree.

	    <li> On the extra credit, think recursively.
	</ul>
