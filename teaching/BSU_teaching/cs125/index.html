<h2>Announcements:</h2>

<ul>
<!--
	<li> <font color="green">Emerald</font> is experiencing 
		difficulties with some of the <tt>awt</tt> 
		packages, including <tt>Image</tt>.  The system
		adminstrators have traced it back to a load library
		problem caused by a change in operating systems
		in January.  The "fix" could break other things
		on the system and is being postponed until after
		classes.
		<br>
		<font color="red">
		Due to this, Program 27 is cancelled.</font>
		The points
		for it will be given to the remaining programs.
		If you have already done Program 27, you may turn
		it in on time for some extra credit, provided you have 
		turned in Program 26 and Program 28 on time.  
-->
	<li> For Program 30, some students have reported problems
		with the Sun demo and Netscape.  If you have troubles,
		use the appletviewer.  Remember that the appletviewer
		will bring up a separate window for each applet, so,
		you will get 3 appletviewer windows for this program.
		<br>
		<b>Hints:</b>  
		<ul>
		    <li> Use the code provided in <tt>ccj</tt> for
		    	both sorts.
		    <li> The method <tt>pause(i,j)</tt> draws the
			red and blue lines at <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt>.
			For the insertion sort, <tt>pause</tt> should be
			called for every comparison (that is, each time 
			through the loops) with the indices of the loop.
		    <li> For mergeSort, you should call <tt>pause</tt>
		    	with the beginning element and ending element
			of the section of the array that's currently
			being sorted (that is, <tt>from</tt> and <tt>to</tt>).
		</ul>

	<li> There will be extra office hours this week to prepare
		for the final exam.  They will be in MG 139:
		<ul>
		    <li> Thursday, 3-4pm: Sample exam questions,
		    	how to study, what to study, making an
			outline, writing the exam, (bring your 
			past exams with you).
		    <li> Friday, 3-4pm: What should be on your
		    	cheat sheet?  How to get the most out of
			your 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper,
			Sample exam questions, 
			(bring your past cheat sheets with you).
		    <li> Sunday, 3-4pm: Taking tests faster,
		    	How to get more partial credit, Sample
			exam questions, (bring your cheat sheet
			for Monday with you).
		</ul>

	<li> There will also be office hours for general questions.  
		They will be in MG 235C on Thursday 10:40-11:30,
		Friday 10:40-11:30am, and on Monday
		9:00-11:30am and 1:00-3:00 pm.
	
	<li> Information about the <a href="finalExam">final exam</a>.
    	
	<li> Programs 1-26 have been graded and 
		returned.<br>
		If you turned in these programs, and have not
		received a grade report, send your instructor e-mail.

	<li> There is a tutor, Susan Dong, for this class. She will be in 
		MG110 Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays 11:40-12:30 and 
		Tuesdays and Thursdays 2:40-3:30.</li>

<h2>Using the Computers:</h2>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://diamond.idbsu.edu/dept-stuff/cspolicy/">Departmental 
    	Computer Policy</a>

    <li> <a href="http://diamond.idbsu.edu/~stjohn/teaching/unix.html">Hints 
    	on using unix</a>

    <li> The accounts for this class live on 
    	<font color="#008000">emerald</font>.
	You cannot log on to any of the other gemstones 
	(i.e. <font color="#0000FF">agate</font>,
	<font color="#FF0000">ruby</font>, 
	<font color="#00FFFF">turquoise</font>,
	etc.). If the graphics terminal you wish to use has a message 
	welcoming you to another gemstone, turn the terminal off and on. 
	This will cause the terminal to reboot and will bring up the list 
	of gemstones (from which you can choose 
	<font color="#008000">emerald</font>).</li>

    <li> You can also use <font color="#008000">emerald</font> from the 
    	Multipurpose Classroom Facility General Computer Lab. Ask one of 
	the assistants for the handout on <b>Reflection X</b>. The handout 
	gives step-by-step instructions.  Insert <tt>emerald.idbsu.edu</tt> 
	for the name of the host.</li>

    <li> If you're interested in working from home, there are several 
    	programs you will need:</li>

    <ul>
	<li> <b>telnet:</b> This is a program that allows you to log on to 
	    a server from your home computer. You can type commands and 
	    edit files (using vi) but cannot do graphics. Telnet is all you 
	    need for the first couple of weeks of the course.</li>

	    <br>If you are using
	    <ul>
		<li> <b>linux:</b> This is included with the kernel.</li>
	
		<li> <b>MacOS:</b> A good version is BetterTelnet, available 
		    from <a href="http://www.cstone.net/~rbraun/mac/telnet/">http://www.cstone.net/~rbraun/mac/telnet/</a>.</li>
	
		<li> <b>Windows:</b> The built-in version is buggy (in can 
		    be accessed by typing <tt>telnet:</tt> into your browser). 
		    You can find free and shareware at
		    <a href="http://www.tucows.com/">http://www.tucows.com/</a>.
	</ul>
	
	<li> <b>ftp:</b> If you would like to edit files at home (using Word, 
	    for example), you need a file transfer program to move the files 
	    to <font color="#008000">emerald</font>.
(More on obtaining ftp later).</li>
	
	<li> <b>jdk:</b> This is the java compiler we're using for the class. 
	    It is available free for most operating systems from 
	    <a href="http://www.java.sun.com">http://www.java.sun.com</a>.
	    You will only need this if you plan to compile programs at home 
	    and then transfer them back to 
	    <font color="#008000">emerald</font>. For this, you
	    will also need the library the book uses which can be 
	    downloaded from 
	    <a href="http://www.horstmann.com/ccj.html">http://www.horstmann.com/ccj.html</a>.</li>
