<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.4, p 413.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.7, p 413.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.8, p 414.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R9.9, p 414.
	<li> Ethics: Consider the Challenger Disaster
		as presented 
		<a href="http://ethics.tamu.edu/ethics/shuttle/shuttle1.htm">here</a> (by Texas A&M University Engineering Ethics).  
		Who is responsible?  What should, or could,
		the engineers have done differently?
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>
<ol>
	
<p>
    <dt><b>P21.</b> (Sorted Merge) P9.6, p 416.  Your program
    	should (in the following order):
	<ol>
	    <li> Ask for the length of the first sorted list of integers.
	    <li> Read in the first list of integers.
	    <li> Ask for the length of the second sorted list of integers.
	    <li> Read in the second list of integers.
	</ol>
	You may assume that the lists are sorted, and you do not
	have to error check for that.
	Your program should then print out the sorted list of
	numbers.  
    	Submit this as program 21 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program21.  

    <dt><b>P22.</b> (Permutations) P9.13, p 417.
    	Submit this as program 22 using the electronic submission.
	Please call the file (and the class) Program22.

    <dt><b>P23.</b> (Connect-the-Dots) Write a applet in 
    	<tt>plain java</tt> that draws a dot when the user clicks
	the mouse and connects that dot to the previous one.
	Your applet should have a clear button that clears what
	has been drawn.  For example: 
<p>
	<applet code="Connect.class"
		width = 300 height = 300>
	</applet>
<p>
	Hints:
	<ul>
	    <li> Modify OneColorDraw.java from <a href="plain.html">plain
	    	java notes</a>.
	    <li> There are two different cases for drawing.
		The first is when there is no previous point to connect
		the new point (this occurs when the applet first starts
		and after the
		clear button has been clicked).  The second case is when
		you do have a previous point and you draw a line between
		the two points.
	    <li> You can draw a "dot" by drawing a "filled rectangle"
	    	of small width and height.
	</ul>
    	Submit this as program 23 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program23.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program23.html
	that displays your applet.
