<ul>
	<li> <b>Catalog Description</b>:
		Data and prodecure abstraction.  Problem-solving
		techniques, recursive algorithms, basic searching and
		sorting techniques.  Introduction to object-based
		programming.  The software development process
		(specification, design, stepwise refinement).
		Social and ethical issues in computing. <br>
		Note: it is recommended that students with no prior
		computing experience take CS113 prior to this couse.

	<li> <b>Prerequisites</b>:
  		M147 (Precalculus), M160 (Calculus),
		or satisfactory placement score.

	<li> <b>Textbook</b>:
		<i>Computing Concepts with Java Essentials</i>
		by Cay Horstmann, Wiley, 1998, and
		<i>Computer Ethics</i> by Tom Forester and Perry
		Morrison, MIT Press, 1995.
		We will also be reading <i>The Cuckoo's Egg</i>
		by Cliff Stoll.

	<li> <b>Grading:</b> The grading for the course will be based on:
		<ul>
			<li> Assignments:	25%
			<li> Ethics Component:  10%
			<li> Midterm Exam 1:	15%
			<li> Midterm Exam 2:	15%
			<li> Midterm Exam 3:	15%
			<li> Final Exam:	20%
		</ul>
	<li> <b>Exams:</b>  The exams will be 
		<ul>
			<li> Midterm Exam 1: Friday, 19 February, 12:40-2:30
				in B105. 
			<li> Midterm Exam 2: Friday, 19 March, 12:40-2:30
				in B105.
			<li> Midterm Exam 3: Friday, 16 April, 12:40-2:30
				in B105.
			<li> Final Exam: Monday, 10 May, 3:30-5:30.
		</ul>
		Since the
		final is comprehensive, if you do better on it than on one
		of the midterm exams, the score on the final may replace
		one of the midterm scores.  Note that the final will be
		long and difficult, so, it is an exceptionally bad idea to
		plan on taking advantage of this.  There will be no makeup
		exams.

	<li> <b>Assignments:</b> Late assignments will have 
		25 percent of their score deducted for each day late.
		Programming assignments will be submitted electronically.
		Full credit will only be given for those programs that
		run correctly and have good documentation and
		programming style.

	<li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
		overall design of the programs and homework.  However, for 
		specific
		programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.

	<li> <b>Computer Accounts:</b> Each student receives an account 
		on <font color="green">emerald</font>, one of
		the department's computers, which runs the linux 
		operating system.
		<ul>
			<li> The dialect of java used in the class is 
			that accepted by the jdk1.1.3 compiler 
			for i386-linux.
			<li> You are responsible for understanding and 
			complying with the departmental computing policy. 
			Violations may result in account suspension.
		</ul>
