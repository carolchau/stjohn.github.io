<p>
    <dt><b>P15.</b> P6.13, p 286 <i>(Prime Numbers)</i>.
    	Submit this as program 15 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program15.  
<p>
    <dt><b>P16.</b> Write a program that will display (in billions)
    	the size of the US Budget Surplus/Deficit from
	1958 to 1998.  For 1958 to 1997, use the numbers
	calculated by Congressional Budget Office
	(the first column of Table E-1 on
	<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=319&sequence=0&from=7">
	http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=319&sequence=0&from=7</a>).  For 1998, assume that
	the projected budget surplus is $63 billion dollars 
	(this also comes from the CBO, the actual number is
	not yet available).  Your program should prompt the user
	for the surplus/deficit for each year.  
	Represent each year as a point
	on the graph.  Choose a suitable coordinate system
	for displaying the data (note that the standard one that runs
	from (-10,-10) to (10,10) doesn't fit the data).
	<br>
	<i>(Hint: Store the data in a file and use Unix file 
	redirection to test your program.)</i>
	<p>
    	Submit this as program 16 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program16.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program16.html
	that displays your applet.
	<p><b>Extra Credit:</b> Connect each point on your
	graph with a line to the previous point.  Add in the
	projected budget surpluses through 2008 and connect
	those by dotted lines.  The budget projections can
	be found at the Congressional Budget Office
	(<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/">
	http://www.cbo.gov</a>).  

<p>
    <dt><b>P17.</b> P8.9, p 365 <i>(Triangles)</i>.
    	Submit this as program 17 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	class and file Triangles, and the test file 
	(and the class) Program17.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program17.html
	that displays your applet.
