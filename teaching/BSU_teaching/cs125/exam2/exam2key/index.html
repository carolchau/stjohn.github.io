<DT>4.
<DD><DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>Explain the differences between a Trojan
horse, a logic bomb, and a virus.
<PRE>
A Trojan horse is a program that allows access to an already-penetrated
system-- for example by establishing a new account with superuser privileges.

A logic bomb is a program that is triggered to act upon detecting a certain
sequence of events-- for example a program written by a disgruntled employee
that destroys system files when the employee is removed from the system.

A virus is a a self-replicating program that causes damage and infects
other programs, floppy disks, or hard disks.
</PRE>			<DT>(b)
<DD>Assume you discover that you can view another
				student's java homework, because they have
				set their permissions incorrectly.  

<P>
Would it be ethical to look at the files?
				Should you notify the owner, the instructor,
				the system adminstrator?
				What is the ethical thing to do, with
				respect to your ethical view?  Please state
				the ethical framework and justify your 
				answer.

<TT>A, B, C, D, F</TT>
				as input and returns the corresponding
				numeric grade <TT>4, 3, 2, 1, 0</TT>.

<DT>10.
<DD>You have been hired by <I>Downward Bound Snowboard Shop</I>,
		a store that rents snowboards, to write a program to
		keep track of their rentals.  <I>Downward Bound</I> 
		stocks several different kinds of snowboards.  For each 
		kind of snowboard, they keep track of the manufacturer of 
		the board, the number of these boards that they 
		own, and the number of these boards that are currently
		rented.  

<P>
When a customer rents or returns a snowboard, the shop 
		updates the number of boards of that kind that are rented.  The
		shop also occasionally retires old snowboards or buys new
		ones, so, the shop needs to be able to update the number
		of boards of each kind it owns. 

<P>
Assume that the shop has three different kinds of snowboards:
		those made by Burton, those made by Ride, and those made
		by Oxygen. Initially, they have 10 of each. 
		<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>What classes would you use in your design? Why?
<PRE>
I would use two classes: Snowboad and Shop.  
Snowboard would keep track of the manufacturer, the total number
of board owned, and the number of boards currently rented.
Shop would have 3 member variables for each of the different kind
of snowboards: Burton, Ride, and Oxygen.
</PRE>			<DT>(b)
<DD>For the classes in your design, what methods
would you have?  Give a <B>brief</B> explanation
				of why you chose these methods:
<PRE>
Snowboard:
  I would have 3 accessor funtions to get the number rented, the
  total stock, and the kind:
  
    getNumRented()
    getTotalStock()
    getKind()
    
  I would also have 3 mutator functions to change the values of
  the member variables:
  
    setNumRented()
    setTotalStock()
    setKind()
    
  There would also be 2 constructors: the default, and one that
  takes a string and 2 integers:
  
    Snowboard(String newKind, int newTotal, int newNumRented)
    
Shop:
   I would have two accessor functions that takes the kind of the
   board.  The first returns the total stock of that kind.  The
   second returns the number rented of that kind:
   
     getTotal()
     getRented()
     
   There would be two mutator functions-- one that updates the
   number of boards rented (given the kind) and the other
   updates the total number of boards:
   
     updateRented()
     updateTotal()
     
   There would also be a default constructor.
</PRE>			<DT>(c)
<DD>What should be included in the test suite for 
				this program?  Why?
<PRE>
First, there should be simple tests that make sure the information is
entered correctly.
Next, you should write tests to make sure the number of boards owned
or rented is not negative.  
You should also test that you do not rent more boards than 
you own, and that you do not retire (that is, remove from the system)
boards that are currently rented to a customer.
