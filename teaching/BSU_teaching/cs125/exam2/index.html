<h1>Information for Exam 2</h1>
<h2>Computer Science 125<br>
Boise State University<br>
Spring 1999</h2>

<h3>General Information</h3>
<ul>

    <li> <a href="exam2key">Answer key</a> for the
    	second exam.

    <li> The second exam is Friday, 19 March, from
    	<font color ="red">12:40-2:40 in B105</font>.
    <li> Any conflicts with the two hour time on Friday 
    	must be discussed with your instructor in advance.
	Alternative arrangements must be made by Friday,
	12 March.
    <li> It will cover the material in:
    <ul>
    	<li> CCJ: Chapters 1-8
	<li> Ethics: Chapters 1-4
	<li> <i>The Cuckoo's Egg</i>
	<li> Handouts from the webpage (e.g. ethics
		pages, sample programs)
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Exam Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li> The exam is closed book and closed notes.  
    <li> When taking the exam, you may have with you 
    	<ul>
	    <li> an 8 1/2" x 11" (or A4) piece of paper filled with 
	    	notes, programs, etc.  
    	    <li> pens or pencils
	</ul>
    <li> You may not use a computer or calculator.
    <li> All books and bags must be left at the front of
    	the classroom during this exam.  This is to keep 
	the aisles clear, so that the proctors can easily
	reach people to answer questions.
    <li> You must be enrolled in the course to take the exam.
    	For every enrolled student, there will be an exam with
	their name on the front page.  These will be laid out
	alphabetically on the desks.  When you find your exam, 
	you may write your name on the exam, but <font color="red">do
	not open it</font> until instructed to do so.  This is
	so everyone has the same amount of time to complete
	the exam.
</ul>

<h3>How to Prepare</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Do the assigned reading.
    <li> Make sure you do all the programs that have been 
    	assigned.  The programs (or parts of them) make
	excellent exam questions.
    <li> Work through the practice problems from the 
	homeworks.  These (or variations of them) often
	appear on exams.
    <li> Work through the exams for past classes.  This
    	is the second semester this course has been taught
	in Java, so, there is only one semester's worth
	of past exams.
