<h2>Introduction to Computer Science</h2>
<h2>Boise State University, Spring 1999</h2>

<p>
    <dt><b>P28.</b> (Puzzle) 
     	Write a class called <tt>PuzzleBoard</tt>.
        <tt>PuzzleBoard</tt> should store 15 <tt>PuzzlePieces</tt>
        (see <a href="hw7.html">Homework 7, P19</a>) and include the
        following methods:
        <ul>
            <li> a default constructor that initializes the 15
                pieces as in the demonstration below.
            <li> a method that draws the puzzle pieces and the
                "Scramble" box.
            <li> a move method that takes a point as its input.
                If the point is contained in the "Scramble" box,
                it calls a second (private) method with a randomly
                chosen position 1000 times.  The purpose is to
                scramble the pieces, so the puzzle can be played.
        </ul>
        Your class should use the <tt>PuzzlePiece</tt> class written
        for P19.
        <p> <tt>PuzzleBoard</tt> will be called by
        <a href="puzzle/Program28.java">Program28.java</a> and should
        work like the following example:
<p>
        <applet codebase = "puzzle" code="Manager.class"
                alt="(Your browser is not Java-enabled.)"
                width = 300 height = 300>
        </applet>
<p>
        Hints:
        <ul>
            <li> Here is the documentation for the classes.  This was
            generated by <tt>javadoc</tt> and includes descriptions of
            the private methods I used in the above implementation.
            You can use private methods of your
            choice.  This documentation is just provided as a guideline.
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="puzzle/PuzzlePiece.html"><tt>PuzzlePiece</tt></a>
.
                <li> <a href="puzzle/PuzzleBoard.html"><tt>PuzzleBoard</tt></a>
.
            </ul>
            <li> Start first with drawing the board.  Make sure that
                works before working on the move function.  Lastly,
                implement the "Scramble" box.
            <li> Think about how you want to represent the "empty" piece.
                One way to do this is to make that part of your array
                empty or null.  For example, if your array is called board,
                you can set the bottom corner to be empty by:
                <pre>board[3][3] = null;</pre>
                Then, to check if a piece is null (to avoid printing it
                or to find the next move):
                <pre> if ( board[i][j] == null )</pre>

                <p>
                Another way to indicate the empty square is by setting it's
                label to a flag, like 0, and adding a <tt>getLabel()</tt>
                method to <tt>puzzlePiece</tt>.  You can then check for the
                "empty" space by:
                <pre> if ( board[i][j].getLabel() == 0 )</pre>
            <li> Write the move method in stages.  First, make it work
                for moving "15" from its initial slot to the empty place.
                Then, work on the implementing the move for the bottom
                row, and so on.
            <li> Since there's multiple files, using makefiles will make
                compiling easier.  Copy the <a href="make.html">sample
                makefile</a> into your directory and change the line
                "java Manager" to "appletviewer Program25".
                Then, to compile and
                run, you only need to type:
                <pre>$ make run</pre>
        </ul>
