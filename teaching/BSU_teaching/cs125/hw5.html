<h1>Homework 5 for Computer Science 125</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Computer Science</h2>
<h2>Boise State University, Spring 1999</h2>

<hr>
<font color="red">This homework is due by 9 p.m., Friday,
	12 March 1999.</font>  See the directions 
	in <a href="hw1.html">Homework 1</a>
	to electronically submit homework.

<h2>Warm-up and Practice Problems</h2>

These are not be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on exams.

<ul>
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.4, p 278.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.11, p 279.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.12, p 279.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.21, p 281.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R6.22, p 281.
</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<font color="red">
    You must include comments for all functions, following the
    <tt>javadoc</tt> format.  See CCJ, p 183-185 for more details.
</font>

<p>
    <dt><b>P13.</b> (bar chart): Exercise P6.8, p 283.  
    	Submit this as program 13 
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program13.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program13.html
	that displays your applet.

	<p>
	<b>Note:</b> You may assume that all input is in integer form,
	and there will be no more than 20 bars.<br>
	Your program should prompt the user
	for all input using the GraphicsApplet interface (not
	the console).  That is, you should use <tt>readInt()</tt>, not
	<tt>Console.in.readInt()</tt>.

	<p>
	<b>Hint:</b> You might want to change the coordinate system
	to match the range of the data (that is, from 0 to 100).  See
	CCJ, p 113 for more details.

			
<p>		
    <dt><b>P14.</b> (random walk): Write a program to simulate the 
    	walk of a drunkard
    	in a square street grid.  Draw a grid of 21 streets
	horizontally and 21 streets vertically (see CCJ, p 271).  
	Place a simulated person at
	the center of the grid (i.e. at (0,0)), denoted by
	a point.  For 100 times, have the simulated person
	randomly pick a direction (east, west, north, south),
	move one block in that direction, and redraw the
	dot.  Circle the starting and stopping positions of
	the walk with a circle of radius one quarter.<p>
	Prompt the user if they would like to try again.  If
	their answer starts with 'y' or 'Y', clear the window
	and simulate another random walk.  If the user enters
	anything else, thank them for playing.<p>
	For example,
	<p>
	<applet code = "RandomWalk.class"
		height = 300
		weight = 300
		alt = "(Your browswer does not run Java applets.)">
	</applet>
	<p>
    	Submit this as program 14 using the electronic submission.  
	Please call the file (and the class) Program14.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program14.html
	that displays your applet.

	<p><b>Extra credit</b> if you also highlight the path that
	the simulated person walks.  Since we're working
	in black and white, one way to do this would be
	to draw a line slightly below and above the path,
	making the path appear as a wider line.

<p>
    <dt><b>P15.</b> (drawing roses): Exercise P6.21, p 288.  Submit this as 
    	program 15 using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program15.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program15.html
	that displays your applet.

	<p><b>For the extra credit:</b> Your program should prompt the user
	for the number of leaves using the GraphicsApplet interface (not
	the console).  That is, you should use <tt>readInt()</tt>, not
	<tt>Console.in.readInt()</tt>.
			
<!-- Save for HW 6
    <dt><b>P16.</b> (Person class) .....  Submit this as program 16
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program16.
	<br>
	Idea for this one:  give a file (with the javadoc comments) for
		a class to hold information about a person and they fill
		in the methods.  Also give them the driver program.  So,
		basically, this program is a very gentle introduction to 
		writing a class.
	(need to provide Program16.java and framework of Person.java)
