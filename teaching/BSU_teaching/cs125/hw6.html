<ul>
        <li> CCJ: Exercise R8.1, p 360.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R8.11, p 361.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R8.21, p 362.
	<li> CCJ: Exercise R8.22, p 362.

	Who is affected by it?  Did the software developer
	act ethically?  Was what she did illegal?

</ul>

<h2>Graded Problems</h2>

<font color="red">
    You must comment your code (see book for examples).<br>
    You must include comments for all functions, following the
    <tt>javadoc</tt> format.  See CCJ, p 183-185 for more details.
</font>

<p>
    <dt><b>P16.</b> (Person class) Implement a class <tt>Person</tt>
        that contains the first name, last name, and birthday of a
	person.  Use the two files provided below:
	<ul>
	    <li> <a href="Person.java">Person.java</a>: contains
	    	the comments and outline of the class (you need to
		fill in the definitions for the methods).
	    <li> <a href="Program16.java">Program16.java</a>: this
	    	file provides a way to test your class.  
	</ul>
    	Submit this as program 16
	using the electronic submission.  Include the classes
	Program16 and Person in separate files.
	<br>
<p>
    <dt><b>P17.</b> (Triangles) Exercise P8.9, p 365.
    	Submit this as program 17 
	using the electronic submission.  
	Include the classes Program17 and Triangle as separate files.  
	Include an HTML	file in the directory called Program17.html
	that displays your applet.
	<br>
<p>
	<b>Note:</b> Your Program17 class should contain a sample
	program that demonstrates the features of the Triangle class.
	It should not ask for input, but it should draw several triangles,
	move them, and redraw them.  
<p>
    <dt><b>P18.</b> (Three Color Draw) 
    	Modify the <a href="plain.html">OneColorDraw</a> applet to
	allow the user to change colors that are drawn.
	Add at least 3 choices of colors and buttons for
	each choice.  For example, if you choose the
	colors red, blue, and black, you should have buttons
	that when pressed, change the color that is drawn
	to red, blue, or black, respectively.  Your applet
	should also have a clear button like OneColorDraw.
	For example:
	<p>
	<applet code="ThreeColorDraw.class"
	width = 300 height = 300>
	</applet>
	<p>
	Submit this as program 18
	using the electronic submission.  Please call the
	file (and the class) Program18.
	Include an HTML file in the directory called Program18.html
	that displays your applet.
