<h1>Laboratory Exercise 3<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
5 September 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today, we're going to go from a page idea to an outline to the
actual webpage.&nbsp; Along the way, we'll talk about some new elements
for quoting and formatting text, and discuss nesting of elements.<br>
</p>
<h3>Segway Journal<br>
</h3>
Before starting the Segway exercises, you will need to download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
The basic journal page for Tony's Segway journey is already in the
files provided above.&nbsp; As a review, we'll discuss in class the
elements on his page.&nbsp; Next, modify his page to take advantage of
the new structure elements we've discussed:<br>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Add &lt;q&gt; element to properly quote his inline quotes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Use a &lt;blockquote&gt; and &lt;br&gt; elements to make his
Burma Shave quote appear correctly.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Make an ordered list of the cities he's visited along his journey</li>
  <li>Make an unordered list of the things he brought with him on the
trip.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
The final activity for today's lab we will add more to the website with
information about you.&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li>If you didn't do so last class, make a folder, called <tt>allAboutMe</tt>
(the root folder) to hold your website and put your webpage from last
time in the folder, renamed as <tt>index.html</tt> (why should you
name it
index.html?) <br>
  </li>
  <li>Add your favorite quote (either inline or block) to your default
page.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Create a new page, titled "Fall 2007 Class Schedule".&nbsp; On
that page make an unordered list of your courses for this semester.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Link your new course page to your default page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
