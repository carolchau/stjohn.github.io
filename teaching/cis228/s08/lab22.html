<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.
</p>
<p>Today's focus is modifying the content of web pages.

<h3>Your Pet, Revisited</h3>
<p>
The Document Object Model (DOM) provides a way to access and 
change parts of your webpage, even if those sections lack 
IDs.  In lecture, we discussed improvements to the Stick Figure
Adventure that show messages directly on the page (instead of
using <tt>alert()'s</tt>.  In today's lab, we will make similar
improvements to your pet page.
</p>
<p>
Alter your pet page from <a href="lab16.html">Lab 16</a> to have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A message that appear below the picture.  The initial message
		should be your greeting.</li>
	<li>Instead of using an <tt>alert()</tt> to say thank you
		when woken (ie clicked on), change the message on your
		page to include the thank you.</li>
	<li>When your pet falls asleep, change the message on your 
		page to reflect his sleepy state.
</ul>
In your pet page, the change in images was accomplished with an
interval timer (ie <tt>setTimeout()</tt>).  One place you will need
to add more code is in this timer.  If it gets too confusing and
long, create a function that contains the resetting of the message
and image, and just use that function inside the interval timer.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
