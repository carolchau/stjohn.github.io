<h2>Lab 4</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2008<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet. We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Favorite Places</h3>
To start off today, make a simple page in your <tt>AllAboutMe</tt>
site, called
<tt>places.html</tt>. The page should have:<br clear="all">
<ol>
  <li>A title, that includes the name of a place you would like to
visit.</li>
  <li>A short description of a place that you would like to visit and
why.</li>
  <li>A link to another page (ie use an URL) that describes the place
you'd like to visit.</li>
  <li>If time, several images of the place. Put those in your
images folder, and use relative paths in the links to them.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Starbuzz and Caffeine Buzz<br>
</h3>
Before starting the Segway exercises, you will need to download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
The original page for Starbuzz Coffee is provided.&nbsp; We'll modify
it to include some of the new features we've discussed in class: <br>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Add in an absolute link to the Caffeine Buzz website.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Add a title to that link, that explains what it does.</li>
  <li>Modify the &lt;a&gt; element for the Caffeine Buzz link to pop up
a new window.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
The final activity for today's lab we will add more to the website with
information about you.&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li>Add titles to all the links on your default page, describing
their content.</li>
  <li>Link your places page to the default page and have it pop up in a
new window.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
