<h2>Lab 9</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2008<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today, we will continue working on style, using the new concepts for
color and font discussed in Chapter 9.

</p>
</div>

<h3>Fonts<br>
</h3>
Next, we're going to look at some basic style related to fonts.&nbsp;
We'll work with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
file in Chapter 9 (the segway
example, revisited):
<ol>
  <li>In the journal folder for Chapter 9, create a file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">journal.css</span> with:<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    <tt>body { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif; <br
 clear="all">
}</tt><br clear="all">
    <tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt> </tt> </li>
  <li>Now, link your new file <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.css</span>
to <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span> and view
the results in a browser.</li>
  <li>Make the body font small (using keywords) and the h1 heading 150%
and h2 heading 120%.&nbsp; View your results in a browser to make sure
the font sizes have changed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>To make the headings stand out less, change the font-weight to
normal.</li>
  <li>Also, add italic font to quotes (i.e. add a rule to your CSS file
that says that all blockquotes should use italic).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Colors</h2>

<p>
In lecture, we discussed several ways to set the color of elements.  
You can use one of the 17 colors that can be specified by keyword 
(i.e. red, blue, green, and their friends), or you can specify the 
red, green, and blue content (RGB) of your desired color.
</p>
<p>
For this part of the lab, we will set colors using RGB content.  
<ol>
  <li>Choose your favorite color.  If you don't have a favorite color, 
  	use Tony's (a dark orange color).
  <li>Take Tony's journal page, <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
and style sheet, <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.css,</span>
and:<br clear="all">
    <ul>
      <li>change the largest headings (<span style="font-family: monospace;">h1</span>)
      	to be your favorite color,
      </li>
      <li>change the next largest headings (<span style="font-family: monospace;">h2</span>) 
      	to be a <em>lighter hue</em> of your favorite color,
      </li>
      <li>change the text in paragraphs
      	to be a <em>darker hue</em> of your favorite color,
      </li>
      <li>add a dotted bottom border to the headings.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
To find the RGB of your favorite colors, you can use the color picker
in the Paint program, experiment by adjusting RGB values in the CSS
file, or use the color chart webpages suggested by the book.
</div>

<h3>All-About-Me Website</h3>
<p>
Modify your style sheet for your website (i.e. the one you created in 
Lab 8):
<ul>
	<li>to set the background color using RGB values,</li>
	<li>to use borders around some element (e.g. around images, around paragraphs, for headings), and</li>
	<li>to use a different font than the default.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
