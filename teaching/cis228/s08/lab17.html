<h2>Lab 17</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2008<br><br>
</h3>

<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>
In today's lab, we will work with cookies, arithmetic, and 
decisions.  

</p>

<h3>Donuts and Cookies</h3>

<p>The book develops the iRock and donut example in the first three chapters.  
We will use the files from Chapter 2 and 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch03.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch03.php</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Using the donut example as a base, modify the JavaScript to remember
the user's name when they return.  The simplest way to do this is to
mimic what was done for iRock.  Recall that the last version of the
iRock asks the user their name and stores it in cookie.
</p>
The steps that need to be done here:
<ul>
	<li> When the name changes, store it in a cookie (how can you tell 
		when a field changes?)
	<li> When the page loads, if the name is known, put it in the input
		field on the form (Hint: Look at the iRock example for checking
		if the cookie exists.  You will want to make this change when
		the onload event has been triggered-- use the &lt;body&gt; element.)
</ul>

<h3>Arithmetic in JavaScript<br>
</h3>
<ol>
</ol>
In lecture, we wrote a calculator for determining the letter grade
given the numerical score. In lab, we'll write a calculator that
takes a decimal number and outputs its hexadecimal code. To make
things simpler,
we will only convert numbers that are &lt; 16. The basic outline
of the program is:
<ol>
  <li>Prompt the user for a number.</li>
  <li>If the number is &gt;= 16, display a message saying the number is
too large for our calculator.</li>
  <li>If the number &lt;=15, print out the single digit hexadecimal for
that number<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Since there's lots of steps to this, let's break it up into
subproblems, detailed in the sections that follow:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Print and Display:</span>
To start, first make a program that prompts the user for a number and
just prints out that same number to the screen (this is to check that
your variables are set up right).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Numbers That Are Too Big:</span>
Next, add in a test if the number is bigger than 15.&nbsp; If so, print
out a message saying so.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Small Numbers:</span> if
the number is &lt;=9, then you can just print out the number (since
numbers that small are the same in hexadecimal or decimal). Add
in a test for this, and test to make sure it works.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Converting the Rest:</span>
Next, if the number is 10, print out "A" (add a test for this).
If the number is 11, print out "B" (add a test for this).  Repeat
with the numbers upto 15. In the end, you'll have several tests,
one for each of the numbers between 10 and 15. Test to make sure
this works.</li>
</ul>
In a future lab, we'll use this work to convert larger hexadecimal
numbers.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
