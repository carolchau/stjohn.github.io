<h2>Lab 16</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2008<br><br>
</h3>

<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>
Today, we'll continue working with storing information in JavaScript
(using variables and cookies) and will also use some simple functions
to interact with the browser.  These include using timers and reacting
appropriately when the browser window has been resized.  
</p>

<h3>Your Pet</h3>

<p>The book develops the iRock in the first three chapters.  Now, it's 
your turn.  We will use the iRock files at:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch03.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch03.php</a>
</blockquote>
Modify the iRock files to create your own interactive pet.  
<ol>
	<li>Find two images for you pet:  a happy one and a sleeping one</li>
	<li>Modify the iRock example (the last file, iRock8.html is a good one to use) to:
		<ol>
			<li> use your images in place of the iRock, 
			<li> have your pet "fall asleep" after 30 seconds of no interaction,
			<li> when you click on the screen, your pet should wake up (i.e. display the 
				happy image) and thank you for waking him up.
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Using Variables<br>
</h3>
<p>Next, let's write a simple program that uses variables. Write a
webpage that uses JavaScript to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>first, ask the user for a number and </li>
  <li>then tells the user the square of that number </li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if the user enters 2, you say 4; if the user
enters 3, you say 9.</p>
<p>Hint: do this in parts, making sure each part works before going onto the next.</p>
</div>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
