<h2>Lab 13</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2008<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's lab focuses on tables, both creating them in HTML and
styling them in CSS.  
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>More on Layouts<br>
</h3>
<p>
We'll style the <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
from Chapter 9.  The goal is to add navigation on the side (like you see in a blog). &nbsp;
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Create a sidebar with links to the entries in his journal.
For example, the first link should be to the entry for August 20, the
next link for the entry on July 14. Use the id attribute to
create anchors in the page (see p 153 for a review).
  </li>
  <li>The sidebar should be to the right, below the title of the
page. Use any page layout or rules you wish to place it there.
  </li>
  <li>The main part of the page and the sidebar should each have
borders around them and different background colors.
  </li>
</ol> 
<p>
</p>

<h3>Tables<br>
</h3>
<p>
Before starting on Tony's pages, you will need to
download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain. If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>

We'll start today with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
from Chapter 13.   The overall goal is to add a table to his page
following the directions in Chapter 13.  The table should have:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Information about the towns visited (see book for data).</li>
  <li>A table inside a table to hold the different ratings from Tess
and Tony.</li>
  <li>The rows should alternate colors.</li>
  <li>The text entries should be aligned, left, center, or right,
depending on type.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
<p>
Take your schedule page from before, and add a fixed element with a link to the Lehman College 
course schedules. This element should stay in the same place, no matter if the text in the main 
window is scrolled up and down. See the "free coffee coupon" example in Chapter 12 as a 
guideline.Ê Your page must have:</p>
<ol>
	<li> A fixed element with a link to the Lehman College course schedule. Your link can 
	be words or an image.</li>
	<li> If the link is an image, remove any borders (ie use pseudoclasses). If the link is 
	words, color the section differently, so it stands out from the background of the main 
	section of your page.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Update your schedule page from before with a table.&nbsp; The table
should have:
<ol>
  <li>a captions with it's name,</li>
  <li>columns for the class, meeting time, room and instructor,</li>
  <li>class name should be right-aligned, all other columns should be
centered,</li>
  <li>and the table headings should be colored differently from the
rest of the table.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p> Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
