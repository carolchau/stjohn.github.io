<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>

<p>Today's focus is using images in webpages.  We will discuss
various attributes for the <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt> element, as well as 
resize images using the Paint program.

<h3>myPod Website
</h3>
Before starting the Segway exercises, you will need to download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain. If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We're going to work with the index.html file in Chapter 5 (for the
myPod site).&nbsp; <br>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Add in the image, seattle.jpg, provided in the Chapter 5
folder.&nbsp; What happens?</li>
  <li>Since it's huge, resize the image to 50% using Paint (under the
accessories menu on Windows), iPhoto (on the Mac), or Adobe Acrobat
Elements if you own a copy.
  </li>
  <li>Add in the rest of the images to the webpage, grouping the
Seattle and England pictures together.</li>
  <li>A thumbnails directory exists and small versions of four out of 
  five of the photos.  Resize the missing one to be 12% size and save 
  it to the thumbnails directory.
</li>
  <li>Redo the page with thumbnails, instead of full size
pictures. Include <tt>&lt;alt&gt;</tt> tags in each <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt> element.
  </li>
  <li>Next, make the thumbnails into links to pages containing the full
size pictures.
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>All-About-Me Website
</h3>
Choose one of your pages with images (for example, the favorite foods
or favorite places), 
and:
<ul>
  <li>add <tt>&lt;alt&gt;</tt> tags to each <tt>&lt;img&gt;</tt> element, describing the
image.<br>
  </li>
  <li>replace your images with thumbnails, that link to a page
containing the full size image.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.</p>
