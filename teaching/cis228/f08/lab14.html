<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>Today, we'll look at forms and CSS.  In a few weeks, we'll revisit 
forms again after we've learned some JavaScript.
</p>

<h3>Forms
</h3>
<p>
Following the Starbuzz example from the textbook (Chapter 14). Create a
form for ordering sandwiches
from the "228 Sandwich Shop". Your form should have the following
choices (the name used by the web application is included in
parenthesis):</p>
<ul>
  <li>first and last names (<tt>firstname</tt> and <tt>lastname</tt>)<br>
  </li>
  <li>type of bread (<tt>bread</tt>)</li>
  <li>toasted or not (<tt>cookingInst</tt>)<br>
  </li>
  <li>choice of filling (<tt>filling</tt>)</li>
  <li>extras (<tt>extras[]</tt>), <br>
  </li>
  <li>and a text area for comments and special instructions (<tt>comments</tt>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first three, you should allow only one answer (i.e. radio buttons
or pull-down menu), while 
for extras (ie mayo, mustard, tomato, etc), multiple answers are
expected (ie checkboxes).</p>
<p>
The web application for processing the form is located at:

</p>
</div>

<h3>Adding Style
</h3>
<p>
Take the basic form that you created above, and add style. Layout
the form using a table.
Then add at least three CSS rules that make the form nicer to look
at. Some suggestions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding color,</li>
<li>changing the borders in the table, and </li>
<li>making the heading stand out via borders and size.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
