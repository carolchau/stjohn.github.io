<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>
Today, we return to loops and incorporate arrays.

<h3>Airplane Reservations</h3>


<p>The first part of today's lab is to change the <a
 href="airplane/reserve.html">airplane seat reservation</a> program to
 allow the user to "unselect" a seat.  With the current version, once
 a seat is selected, it can't be undone. </p>
 
<p>Change the program so that if an occupied seat (i.e. one that says
"Full") is clicked, it then returns to being unoccupied (and displays
"Coach").  Note that you only need to change one block of code to 
accomplish this.</p>

<p>Some useful images to have in your directory are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="airplane/coach.jpg">coach icon</a> and 
<li> <a href="airplane/full.jpg">full icon</a>. 
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<p>In lecture, we discussed how to set up the <a
 href="../ticTacToe/index.html">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> game using an array.
The example in class allowed the users to play, but didn't check for a
winner.  Your assignment is to fill in the function,
checkForWinner(). The function should return true if there's a
winner and false otherwise.  A player wins at Tic-Tac-Toe if they
have three in a row, in a column, or diagonally.</p>
<p>For Tic Tac Toe, you will need the following files:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="../ticTacToe/index.html">index.html</a>  </li>
		<li> <a href="../ticTacToe/O.jpg">O.jpg</a> </li>
		<li> <a href="../ticTacToe/X.jpg">X.jpg</a>  </li>
		<li> <a href="../ticTacToe/empty.jpg">empty.jpg</a>  </li>
	</ul>
<p>
The easiest way to do this program is to first write the JavaScript to
see if the moves in the first row all belong to the same player (and
are not equal to "empty").
After that, then write the test for the other rows, then the columns,
and then the diagonals.</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
