SEI Meeting
7 January 2009

Davis work:

David has more time for this project.

Deb: Working with Rob's template.
Starting with TSP, treat template as a rubber
thing that gets based on the data.  Doesn't 
use landmarks.
Establish correspondence between two different
skulls, everywhere (every single point!), not 
just at inputted landmarks.

Improved landmark transfer process.
Able to transfer a large set of landmarks from
the atlas (about 400 points).
Then iterate, using TPS, to more closely
place the landmarks on the data.

atlas = 400 landmarks
template = all of the points from Rob's 
guide tree

Goals:
Missing data
Un-deform
