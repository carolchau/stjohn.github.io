<h1>Laboratory Exercise 7<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
1 October 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet.&nbsp; We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.&nbsp;
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
<h3>Using XHTML<br>
</h3>
Before starting the lounge and segway page exercises, you will need to
download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We're going to work with the index.html file in Chapter 7 (the segway
example, revisited).&nbsp; <br>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Add/change in the &lt;DOCTYPE&gt; tag at the
top of the <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
file to be strict XHTML .</li>
  <li>Use the validator, <a href="http://validator.w3.org">http://validator.w3.org</a>,
to check if the page meets standards.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Remember that empty elements need to end in " /&gt;" instead of
"&gt;".<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fix any mistakes (hint: inline elements must be in blocks) and
try the validator again.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
The final activity for today's lab we will to choose a page that you've
written for a previous lab and modify it to meet XHTML 1.0
standards.&nbsp; Use the validator to verify that the page is in
standard XHTML.<br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
