<h1>Laboratory Exercise 1</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
27 August 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>
<p>
The department has the following policies for
the lab:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> There is no eating or drinking in the lab. </li>
  <li> Due to restricted class sizes, children are not allowed in the
computer labs. </li>
  <li> Do not waste paper-- only print files that directly relate to
the class. </li>
  <li> Do not enter the lab until the scheduled class time. If the lab
is open before class time, it is because another class is using it or
for maintenance. </li>
  <li> Always log out and turn off the monitor when you leave the lab. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
First, turn on the computer-- the button is
in the front. The monitor should also come on, if it doesn't,
the button for it is also in the front. It will take a few moments for
the computer to get started. Some machines in the department are set up
as dual boot.&nbsp; If yours is, you will then see a RedHat logo
on the left hand side of the screen, and the words <tt>linux</tt>
and <tt>win</tt> in a white box on the right. Choose <tt>win </tt>and
hit return. These machines are "dual-boot," with both Linux
and Windows. By choosing <tt>linux</tt>, the machine will boot up
under the Windows operating system.&nbsp;
<h3>Starbuzz Webpage</h3>
Before starting the Starbuzz webpage, download the files provided on
the book's webpage to <br>
a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; The book's website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
The goal is to create a webpage for Starbuzz Coffee Shops.&nbsp; We'll
follow the book's directions.&nbsp; Here's an outline:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create an HTML file using Notepad or TextEdit (see p 12-15 if you
need directions).</li>
  <li>Type in the CEO's desired webpage (either from p 17 or overhead
screen) and save as index.html in a new folder starbuzz (best done on
your floppy or USB drive, since the machines are regularly cleaned of
files).&nbsp; See p 18-19 if you need help creating directories and
saving files.</li>
  <li>Open your new webpage in a browser (see p&nbsp; 20).</li>
  <li>The initial version has no structure, so, add in the HTML tags
discussed in class to format page with title, paragraphs and headers.</li>
  <li>Display your webpage again, by using the "Open File" menu item
again or using the reload button.</li>
</ol>
Next, build a webpage for the mission statement of the coffee shop (see
p 27).<br>
<h3>All-About-Me Webpage<br>
</h3>
The final activity for today's lab is to build a webpage with
information about you.&nbsp; It should include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Your name (and preferred nickname, if any)</li>
  <li>Your preferred email <br>
  </li>
  <li>Your major (and minor, if any)</li>
  <li>Your expected graduation date</li>
  <li>Your past computer experience</li>
</ul>
You should use HTML to structure the page and at least 3 CSS commands
to provide style.<br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp; Also, print out the page with your name and give it to her
before leaving.
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
