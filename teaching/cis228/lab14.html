<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet.&nbsp; We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.&nbsp;
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
<h3>Tables<br>
</h3>
<ol>
</ol>
Before starting the lounge exercises, you will need to
download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We'll finish today with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
from Chapter 13.&nbsp; The overall goal is to add a table to his page
following the directions in Chapter 13.&nbsp; The table should have:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Information about the towns visited (see book for data).</li>
  <li>A table inside a table to hold the different ratings from Tess
and Tony.</li>
  <li>The rows should alternate colors.</li>
  <li>The text entries should be aligned, left, center, or right,
depending on type.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<tt><br>
</tt>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
Update your schedule page from before with a table.&nbsp; The table
should have:<br>
<ol>
  <li>a captions with it's name,</li>
  <li>columns for the class, meeting time, room and instructor,</li>
  <li>class name should be right-aligned, all other columns should be
centered,</li>
  <li>and the table headings should be colored differently from the
rest of the table.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
