<h2>Lab 8</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2009<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the lab.
</p>

<p>In today's lab, we'll return to style and work with Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS).  
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Back to Style<br>
</h3>
Before starting the lounge exercises, you will need to
download the files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain. If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We're going to work with the <tt>lounge.html</tt>
file in Chapter 8 (the lounge
example, revisited).
<ol>
  <li>Add the style described in the book <tt>lounge.html</tt> to change:
    <ul>
      <li>the font in paragraphs to maroon</li>
      <li>make headings use sans-serif fonts in gray</li>
      <li>add underlining (bottom-border) to h1 headings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now, move your style rules to a new page <tt>lounge.css</tt>, and link it to 
  <tt>lounge.html</tt>.</li>
  <li>Use the same set of style rules (ie link to <tt>lounge.css</tt>) for 
  <tt>directions.html</tt>, and <tt>exilir.html</tt>.
  </li>
  
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Classes<br>
</h3>
The last part of Chapter 8 covers classes in CSS.  
<ol>
  <li>Add classes to the <tt>elixir.html</tt>
and <tt>lounge.css</tt> to make:
    <ul>
      <li>the paragraph about green tea have green text.</li>
      <li>the paragraph about raspberry elixir have blue text.</li>
      <li>the paragraph about blueberry elixir have purple text. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do the exercise on p 326.</li>
  <li>Validate your <tt>lounge.css</tt> file using the CSS validator:<br>
    <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator</a>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>


<div>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
<p>
Create a style sheet for your website with at least 3 rules and one
class.  Link
three or more of your pages to the style sheet, as you did for the
lounge site.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.
</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.</p>
