<h2>Lab 19</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>

<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>
Today, we'll finish up the Stick Figure Adventure from last
lab and then start on a program using loops.  
</p>

<div>
<h3>Stick Figure Adventure</h3>
<p>First, we'll finish up a program from Chapter 4: Stick Figure Adventure</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Starting with <tt>sfa1.html</tt>,
there are two paths that currently end as "To Be Continued."  Choose one of 
those paths and extend it with at least two more scenes.  For each of your
new scene, find an image to represent it and store it in the directory of 
images.  You should have at least one decision in your new part
of your adventure.</p>

<p>
Hint:  You will find it easiest to use images that are already in the 
PNG format and name them after the scene they will appear in (e.g. <tt>scene10.png</tt>).
If you have an image that's not in PNG, you can convert it via several 
online programs.  Here's a partial list:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.piccyfix.com/">http://www.piccyfix.com/</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://snipshot.com/">http://snipshot.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Arithmetic in JavaScript<br>
</h3>
<ol>
</ol>
In lecture, we wrote a calculator for determining the letter grade
given the numerical score. In lab, we'll write a calculator that
takes a decimal number and outputs its hexadecimal code. To make
things simpler,
we will only convert numbers that are &lt; 16. The basic outline
of the program is:
<ol>
  <li>Prompt the user for a number.</li>
  <li>If the number is &gt;= 16, display a message saying the number is
too large for our calculator.</li>
  <li>If the number &lt;=15, print out the single digit hexadecimal for
that number<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Since there's lots of steps to this, let's break it up into
subproblems, detailed in the sections that follow:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Print and Display:</span>
To start, first make a program that prompts the user for a number and
just prints out that same number to the screen (this is to check that
your variables are set up right).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Numbers That Are Too Big:</span>
Next, add in a test if the number is bigger than 15.&nbsp; If so, print
out a message saying so.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Small Numbers:</span> if
the number is &lt;=9, then you can just print out the number (since
numbers that small are the same in hexadecimal or decimal). Add
in a test for this, and test to make sure it works.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Converting the Rest:</span>
Next, if the number is 10, print out "A" (add a test for this).
If the number is 11, print out "B" (add a test for this).  Repeat
with the numbers upto 15. In the end, you'll have several tests,
one for each of the numbers between 10 and 15. Test to make sure
this works.</li>
</ul>
In a future lab, we'll use this work to convert larger hexadecimal
numbers.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.</p>
