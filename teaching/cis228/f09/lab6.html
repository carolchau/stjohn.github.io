<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.
</p>
<p>Today's lab wraps up what we've learned this far and discusses
proper form for HTML.  To verify that pages are in good form, we
will use an HTML validator on several different pages, correcting
problems as we go.
</p>

<h3>Using Standard HTML
</h3>
<p>
Before starting the lounge page exercises, you will need to download
the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain. If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We're going to work with the index.html file in Chapter 6 (the lounge
example, revisited).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add in the <tt>&lt;DOCTYPE&gt;</tt> tag (in <tt>doctype.txt</tt> or book) at the
top of the <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.html</span>
file.</li>
  <li>Use the validator, <a href="http://validator.w3.org">http://validator.w3.org</a>,
to check if the page meets standards.
  </li>
  <li>Add in the suggested <tt>&lt;META&gt;</tt> tag, and try the validator
again.
  </li>
  <li>Fix any mistakes (hint: inline elements must be in blocks) and
try the validator again.
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>All-About-Me Website
</h3>
<p>
The final activity for today's lab we will to choose a page that you've
written for a previous lab and modify it to meet HTML 4.01
standards. Use the validator to verify that the page is in
standard HTML.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.</p>
