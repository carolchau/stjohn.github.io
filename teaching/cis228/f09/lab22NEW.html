<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>

<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>Today's focus is events and validating forms.

<h3>Validating Forms</h3>
<p>
In lecture, we discussed how to validate if fields of a form were empty
(see <a href="../formJS.html">formJS.html</a>). For this part of
lab, we will extend that program to check if the state abbreviation and
zip codes are of the proper length. Doing this program breaks into
several parts:
<ol>
  <li>Write a function, validateState(), that tests if the input if of
length 2.</li>
  <li>Write a function, validateZip(), that tests if the input is a
number and if of length 5.
  </li>
  <li>Connect each of these functions to the appropriate form fields,
when the focus leaves these fields (hint: <tt>onblur</tt>).
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
