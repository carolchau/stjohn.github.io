<h2>Lab 10</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2009<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the lab.
</p>
<p>Today, we'll try out some of the new concepts in Chapter 10 on 
borders, margins, and spacing.  
</p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Spacing, Borders, and Margins</h3>
<p>Before starting the lounge exercises, you will need to
download the files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain. If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll work with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.css</span>
file in Chapter 10 (the lounge
example, revisited):</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the lounge folder for Chapter 10, create a file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.css</span> with:<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    <tt>body { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; font-size: small;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif; <br clear="all">
}<br>
h1,h2 { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; color: #007e7e;<br>
}<br>
h1 { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; font-size: 150%;<br>
}<br>
h2 { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; font-size: 130%;<br>
}<br>
    </tt> </li>
  <li>The link already exists in <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.html</span>,
so, when you view the file you should see the effect of the above rules.</li>
  <li>Our goal is to match the <a
 href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/chapter10/completedlounge/lounge.html">completed
journal page</a>.&nbsp; To do this, alter the style for the guarantee
paragraph:<br clear="all">
    <ol>
      <li>Add space around text (hint: padding).</li>
      <li>Increase all the margins.</li>
      <li>Add in the background image, images/background.gif and place
a single copy of it in the upper left hand corner.</li>
      <li>Add a dashed white border around the text.</li>
      <li>Adjust the left padding and right margins to match the
completed page.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>All-About-Me Website</h3>
Choose a page that has multiple paragraphs that you've recently
developed for your website. (If you don't have a page with
multiple paragraphs, then add some more content to one of your
pages.)  Choose a paragraph, and add at least 3 style rules that
make it stand out from other paragraphs. 
</div>

<div>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.</p>
