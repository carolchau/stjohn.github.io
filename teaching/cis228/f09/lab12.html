<h2>Lab 12</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2009<br><br>
</h3>
</div>


<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the lab.</p>
<p>Today's lab focuses on flow and layout of the page.  Our first 
step in this direction will be creating menus that float on the 
side of the page and setting up "footers" at the bottom of the page.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Pseudoclasses</h3>

<p>Pseudoclasses allow you to style things like link colors.  Following
up on <a href="lab11.html">last lab's</a> lounge example, </p>
<blockquote>
Add to the style sheet, rules that change the colors of links
when unvisited, visited, and hovering.&nbsp; Use any colors (the book
suggests #007e7e, #333333, and #0d5353).
</blockquote>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Flow and Layouts</h3>
<p>
Before starting the new exercises, you will need to
download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll work today with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">starbuzz.html</span>
from Chapter 12 (the coffee example, revisited).
We'll focus on the CSS file (since the
&lt;div&gt; element has already been added to the HTML file):</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the HTML file, move the sidebar logical section to where you
would like it to "float" (ie right below the logo and intro).</li>
  <li>In CSS, set the width of the sidebar logical section.</li>
  <li>In CSS, add the rule to "float" the sidebar to the right hand
side of the page.</li>
</ol>


<h3>More on Layouts<br>
</h3>
<p>
We'll style the <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
from Chapter 9.  The goal is to add navigation on the side (like you see in a blog).
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a sidebar with links to the entries in his journal.
For example, the first link should be to the entry for August 20, the
next link for the entry on July 14. Use the id attribute to
create anchors in the page (see p 153 for a review).
  </li>
  <li>The sidebar should be to the right, below the title of the
page. Use any page layout or rules you wish to place it there.
  </li>
  <li>The main part of the page and the sidebar should each have
borders around them and different background colors.
  </li>

    
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
<p>
Take your favorite foods page and add a sidebar that gives a short
description of where you can find those foods-- either links to
restaurants or to recipe books if home-made.  Make sure you place
the sidebar section in the correct place to "float" (ie below the
opening heading, but above your other text).
</p>
<p>
Also, add style commands that alter how links are displayed in
your page.  You can just change the color, as in the lounge page 
above, or be more creative.
</p>

<p>
Note: to float a
section, the section must have its width set (otherwise it defaults to
the width of the whole page and the float will appear to do nothing).</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
