<h2>Lab 20</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2008<br><br>

<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>
Today, we return to loops and incorporate arrays.
</p>
</div>

<div>


<h3>Airplane Reservations</h3>


<p>The first part of today's lab is to change the <a
 href="airplane/reserve.html">airplane seat reservation</a> program to
 allow the user to "unselect" a seat.  With the current version, once
 a seat is selected, it can't be undone. </p>
 
<p>Change the program so that if an occupied seat (i.e. one that says
"Full") is clicked, it then returns to being unoccupied (and displays
"Coach").  Note that you only need to change one block of code to 
accomplish this.</p>

<p>Some useful images to have in your directory are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="airplane/coach.jpg">coach icon</a> and 
<li> <a href="airplane/full.jpg">full icon</a>. 
</ul>


<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<p>In lecture, we discussed how to set up the <a
 href="../ticTacToe/index.html">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> game using an array.
The example in class allowed the users to play, but didn't check for a
winner.  Your assignment is to fill in the function,
checkForWinner(). The function should return true if there's a
winner and false otherwise.  A player wins at Tic-Tac-Toe if they
have three in a row, in a column, or diagonally.</p>
<p>For Tic Tac Toe, you will need the following files:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="../ticTacToe/index.html">index.html</a>  </li>
		<li> <a href="../ticTacToe/O.jpg">O.jpg</a> </li>
		<li> <a href="../ticTacToe/X.jpg">X.jpg</a>  </li>
		<li> <a href="../ticTacToe/empty.jpg">empty.jpg</a>  </li>
	</ul>
<p>
The easiest way to do this program is to first write the JavaScript to
see if the moves in the first row all belong to the same player (and
are not equal to "empty").
After that, then write the test for the other rows, then the columns,
and then the diagonals.</p>

<h3>Finding Bugs</h3>

<p>
An important part of programming is to be able to locate and fix bugs.
The goal of today's lab is to find (and fix!) all the bugs in the following
file:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="../donutBugs/donutsBugs.html">donutsBugs.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
This page should prompt a user for their name and the donuts and 
bagels they wish to purchase.  Currently, there are too many bugs
in the file for it to do this.
Using the error console in the Mozilla Firefox browser, find each
bug and fix it.  
</p>
<p>
Some useful things to remember when hunting for bugs:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> If you would like the graphics to appear and the style to look
		as before, save this file to the directory containing your donut
		page from before.
	<li> Bugs often occur the line above which the error console reports.
		So, look both at the line reported and the line above.
	<li> A single bug can cause multiple error messages.  So, fixing the
		first one reported on the error console will often get rid of 
		multiple error messages.
	<li>  Use the "clear" button on the error console between multiple
		runs of your program.  This will keep you from confusing old
		errors with the current ones.
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
