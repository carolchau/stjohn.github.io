<h2>Lab 23</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2009<br><br>

<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>Today's focus is validating forms.
</p>

<h3>Validating Forms</h3>
<p>
In lecture, we discussed how to validate if fields of a form were empty
(see <a href="../formJS.html">formJS.html</a>). For this part of
lab, we will extend that program to check if the state abbreviation and
zip codes are of the proper length. Doing this program breaks into
several parts:
<ol>
  <li>Write a function, validateState(), that tests if the input if of
length 2.</li>
  <li>Write a function, validateZip(), that tests if the input is a
number and if of length 5.
  </li>
  <li>Connect each of these functions to the appropriate form fields,
when the focus leaves these fields (hint: <tt>onblur</tt>).
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Blog Entries</h3>

<p>We will use the blog developed in Chapter 9 of the book: 
<blockquote>
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch09/youcube/youcube4.html">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch09/youcube/youcube4.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
The initial tasks are:</p>
<ul>
	<li> To familiarize yourself with the code, 
your first task is to add three more blog entries to the existing blog.</li>
	<li> Next, modify the <tt>Blog</tt> object to also include the <tt>author</tt>
of the blog.  That is, change the constructor to take a third argument
(the name of the author) and set it inside the constructor (in a similar
fashion to that for the entry and date.  Change the existing blog entries to
have authors (give at least three different authors).</li>
	<li>Change the existing blog entries to include the author of each entry.</li>
	<li>Change the <tt>showBlog()</tt> function to also show the author for each
		entry</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Sorting by Date and Author</h3>

<p>The existing blog sorts the entry by date.  Since we now store the author,
we'll give the user the choice of sorting by date or by author's name.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add a button that allows the user to sort by date (hint: use the
		existing sort function).</li>
	<li>Add a button and associated function that allows the user to sort
		by author <BR>
		Hint: this is very similar to what you did for dates, except to 
		compare strings use:
		<pre>
			return blog1.author > blog2.author
		</pre>
		</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
