<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>
In today's lab, we will work with timers, style, and arithmetic.

<h3>Changing Style</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../annoyingWindow.html">annoying window</a> example, 
a window repeatedly pops up after 3 seconds.  Make the following changes
to the program:
<ul>
	<li> Make the window reappear after 1 second.</li>
	<li> Add another "button" that when pushed, makes the window
		twice as wide.<br>
		(Hint:  the width of the window can be set, using <tt>style.width</tt>.)</li>
	<li> Add another "button" that when pushed, turns the background
		color of the window red.
</ul>
</div>

<h3>iRock Friend</h3>

<p>Working with 
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch03/irock/irock6.html">iRock6.html</a>
from Chapter 3, create a new file where iRock has a friend.  You can create a 
new character (ie find 2 images on the web) or reuse the images of iRock.  When 
the page first loads, the user should see the two friends on the page.  The old
friend (ie iRock) should start out sad, but become happy when clicked on.  The
new friend should do the opposite:  it should start out happy but become sad 
when clicked on.

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
