<h2>Lab 2</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Fall 2009<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting started and the rules for the
lab.
</p>

<h3>Lounge, Revisited<br>
</h3>
<p>
Before starting the lounge exercises, you will need to download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; The book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
The files are stored in zip format.  Remember that you need to save the
zip file to disk, then extract the files, before you can modify them (as
needed for this lab).
</p>

<p>
The goal for today's lab
is to create organize the lounge website, using folders.&nbsp;
We'll
follow the book's directions.&nbsp; Here's an outline:<br>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Organize the lounge site into folders (see p 60), grouping like
items together.</li>
  <li>Fix the links on the pages to include relative paths.&nbsp; Don't
forget to also fix image links and links to parent directories (i.e. in
<tt>directions.html</tt>).</li>
  <li>Do the Relativity Grand Challenge on p 70.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
The final activity for today's lab is to build a website with
information about you.&nbsp; We'll start with the page you built last
class and add more.&nbsp; <br>
<ul>
  <li>If you didn't do so last class, make a folder, called <tt>allAboutMe</tt>
(the root folder) to hold your website and put your webpage from last
time in the folder, renamed as <tt>index.html</tt> (why should you
name it
index.html?) <br>
  </li>
  <li>Create a folder, <tt>images</tt>, inside <tt>allAboutMe</tt> to hold images.
Choose
two images (i.e. your favorite drinks from the book's files) and store
them in that directory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Make a new folder, <tt>food</tt> to contain a page about your favorite
foods (we'll add more to this folder in later labs). 
This new page, <tt>favFood.html</tt> should have at least two links to images (i.e.
your favorite drinks, now residing in your <tt>images</tt> folder).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Link your pages together: create a link from your <tt>allAboutMe</tt>
page
to your favorite foods page, and vice versa.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
