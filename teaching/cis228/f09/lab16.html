<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>Today, we continue with JavaScript, focusing on incorporating
it into webpages and using variables built-in functions, like
<tt>alert()</tt>.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Sandwich Shop, Revisited</h3>
<p>
Add to your <tt>228 Sandwich Shop</tt> page (from 
<a href="lab14.html">Lab 14</a>) some JavaScript that will
display a message every time they choose a different radio button.
If you did not use radio buttons in your sandwich shop, instead have
it display a message every time a checkbox is changed.<br>
(Hint:  use the <tt>onclick</tt> event handler as you did for the
multiple alerts from <a href="lab15.html">Lab 15</a>.</p>
</div>




<div>
<h3>Using Variables and Constants
</h3>

<p>
In the <a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch01/irock/irock3.html">iRock examples</a>,
we used a variable (<tt>userName</tt>) to store the name of the user and use it in a greeting.
Variables can also be used to store information entered into forms.  We will add additional 
variables to the donut shop example from the book, to allow more donuts and bagels to be
purchased.</p>

<p>
We build a bigger donut shop that allows the user to order
other kinds of donuts.  (You will need to download the files from
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch02.php">Chapter 2</a>
to complete this sections of the lab.
Start with the file <tt>donuts5.html</tt>.
Note that <tt>const</tt> does not work on Internet Explorer.  If
you are using IE, make sure you download the alternative version of 
this page.)</p>

<p>Add to the donut page:</p>
<ul>
	<li> another kind of donuts that can be ordered (at 50 cents a donut),</li>
	<li> also allow the user to order bagels (at 75 cents a bagel),</li>
	<li> following the format for cake and glazed donuts, include these
		two new options in the final total for the order.
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
