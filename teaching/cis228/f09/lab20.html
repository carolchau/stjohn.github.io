<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>
Today, we work with loops.
</p>

<div>
<h3>Loops<br>
</h3>
<p>For each part, you may use either <tt>for</tt> or <tt>while</tt>
loops, whichever you choose. Write the following programs:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Modify the temperature table from the <a href="../forLoops.html">examples</a>
  	to print out the temperatures to 100, counting by fives.  That is, your table
  	should have entries for 0, 5, 10, 15, ..., 100.</li>
  <li>Write a program that will display 10 different hues of
<b>blue</b>.  Note that in class we discussed a program that
displayed 10 different hues of red.</li>
  <li>Write a guessing game program that asks the user to guess your
secret number.  If they enter a number that's too low, tell them
so, and prompt them for another guess.  Similarly, if they enter a
number that's too high, tell them so, and prompt them for another
guess. When they guess the correct number, congratualate them.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
