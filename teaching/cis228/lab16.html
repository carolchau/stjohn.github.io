<h1>Laboratory Exercise 16<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
14 November 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet.&nbsp; We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.&nbsp;
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
<h3>Getting Started with JavaScript<br>
</h3>
<ol>
</ol>
For your first JavaScript program, we're going to add a "Hello World"
dialog box to an existing page.&nbsp; So choose your favorite page from
your AllAboutMe website, and add an alert() that says "Hello World!"
when the page loads.&nbsp; Note this follows the format of <a
 href="simpleJS.html">simpleJS.html</a> almost exactly.<br>
<h3>Clicking Event</h3>
In lecture, we had a page that reacted when the mouse was clicked (<a
 href="variables.html">variables.html</a>).&nbsp; This was accomplished
using the onclick() function.&nbsp; If the onclick() method is put in
the &lt;body&gt; element, then it applies to the whole page.&nbsp; What
happens if it is put in another element?&nbsp; Add an image to the <br>
<a href="variables.html">variables.html</a> page and move the onclick()
method call to the &lt;img&gt; element.&nbsp; What happens?<br>
<br>
Add a second image to the page, and have it do something different (ie
displays a different message, brings up a different kind of dialog box,
etc) when the user clicks on that image.<br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
