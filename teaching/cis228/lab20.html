<h1>Laboratory Exercise 20<br>

<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>

<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using arrays, or lists of data.&nbsp; We will only
work with simple arrays, but it is possible to have arrays of arrays
(called two-dimensional arrays).&nbsp; See the on-line tutorial for
more information.<br>
</p>
<h3>Airplane Reservations</h3>
The first part of today's lab is to extend the <a
 href="airplane/reserve.html">airplane seat reservation</a> program to
have a row of first class seats (here's the jpegs for the <a
 href="airplane/coach.jpg">coach icon</a>, <a href="airplane/full.jpg">full
icon</a>, and <a href="airplane/first.jpg">first class icon</a>).&nbsp;
Your airplane
should have a total of 4 rows of 6 seats-- 1 row of first class and 3
rows of coach seats.&nbsp; The selecting seats should not change, but
you will need to update the HTML and initialization to handle the
additional seats.<br>
<h3>Tic Tac Toe<br>
</h3>
In lecture, we discussed how to set up the <a
 href="ticTacToe/index.html">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> game using an array.&nbsp;
The example in class allowed the users to play, but didn't check for a
winner.&nbsp; Your assignment is to fill in the function,
checkForWinner().&nbsp; The function should return true if there's a
winner and false otherwise.&nbsp; A player wins at Tic-Tac-Toe if they
have three in a row, in a column, or diagonally.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The easiest way to do this program is to first write the JavaScript to
see if the moves in the first row all belong to the same player (and
are not equal to "empty").&nbsp;
After that, then write the test for the other rows, then the columns,
and then the diagonals.<br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
