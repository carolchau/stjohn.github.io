<h2>Lab 16</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2009<br><br>
</h3>

<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>Continuing with JavaScript, today's lab focuses on using 
variables and simple functions.
</p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Using Variables and Constants
</h3>
We build a bigger donut shop that allows the user to order
other kinds of donuts.  (You will need to download the files from
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch02.php">Chapter 2</a>
to complete this sections of the lab.
Start with the file <tt>donuts5.html</tt>.
Note that <tt>const</tt> does not work on Internet Explorer.  If
you are using IE, make sure you download the alternative version of 
this page.)</p>

<p>Add to the donut page:</p>
<ul>
	<li> another kind of donuts that can be ordered (at 50 cents a donut),</li>
	<li> also allow the user to order bagels (at 75 cents a bagel),</li>
	<li> following the format for cake and glazed donuts, include these
		two new options in the final total for the order.
</ul>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Sandwich Shop, Revisited</h3>
<p>
Add to your <tt>228 Sandwich Shop</tt> page some JavaScript that will
test if the user entered their name in the form.  If they didn't, bring
up a dialog box that asks them to re-enter their name. </p>

<p>Hint:  Reuse the JavaScript developed for the donut shop example
above.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
