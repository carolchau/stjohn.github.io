<h2>Lab 20</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2008<br><br>
</h3>
</div>

<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is functions.  
</p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Mandango Seats
</h3>
<p>First, we'll work with the Mandango program from Chapter 6:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch06.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch06.php</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Add a button to the webpage, "Clear Seats", which resets all the 
seats to empty.  To do this, you will also need to write a new
(very short) function that is called when the button is clicked.
</p>
<p>Note: an easy way to make sure your changes are shown on the
webpage is to call the <tt>initSeats()</tt> function after you have
reset the values of the array.

<div>
<h3>Functions with Parameters
</h3>
<p>
First, create a new webpage that will display different messages when
different sections of the page have been clicked, using
the displayMessage() function from <a href="../functions.html">functions.html</a>.
On your new page, you should have at least
three elements that display messages when clicked.  None of your
three elements may be form buttons; instead, use images, divs, tables,
etc.  Each of the three elements should display a different
message.</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
