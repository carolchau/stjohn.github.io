<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>
Today, we'll finish up the Stick Figure Adventure from last
lab and then start on a program using loops.  
</p>

<h3>Timely Greetings</h3>

<p>
Write a JavaScript program that will greet the user with 
"Good Morning" if it is before 11 in the morning, or 
"Good Day" after 11.  A good place to start would be to 
modify an early <a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch01/irock/irock2.html">iRock 
file</a> that greets the user.
</p>

<p>
To find out the current hour, use the following piece
of code:
</p>
<pre>
    var currentDate = new Date();
    var hour = currentDate.getHours();
</pre>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Stick Figure Adventure</h3>
<p>First, we'll finish up a program from Chapter 4: Stick Figure Adventure</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch04.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch03.php</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Starting with <tt>sfa1.html</tt>,
there are two paths that currently end as "To Be Continued."  Choose one of 
those paths and extend it with at least two more scenes.  For each of your
new scene, find an image to represent it and store it in the directory of 
images.  You should have at least one decision in your new part
of your adventure.</p>

<p>
Hint:  You will find it easiest to use images that are already in the 
PNG format and name them after the scene they will appear in (e.g. <tt>scene10.png</tt>).
If you have an image that's not in PNG, you can convert it via several 
online programs.  Here's a partial list:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.piccyfix.com/">http://www.piccyfix.com/</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://snipshot.com/">http://snipshot.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.</p>
