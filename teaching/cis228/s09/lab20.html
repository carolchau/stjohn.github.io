<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>

<h3>Guessing Game</h3>

<p>Write a guessing game program that asks the user to guess your
secret number:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If they enter a number that's too low, tell them
		so, and prompt them for another guess. </li> 
	<li> Similarly, if they enter a number that's too high, 
	tell them so, and prompt them for another guess. </li>
	<li> When they guess the correct number, congratualate them and
	end the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good place to start is by modifying the "guess a password"
program from the <a href="../whileLoops.html">while loops</a>
example.
</div>


<div>

<div>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
