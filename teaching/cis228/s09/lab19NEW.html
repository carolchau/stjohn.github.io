Today, we'll finish up the Stick Figure Adventure from last
lab and then start on a program using loops.

<h3>Stick Figure Adventure</h3>
<p>First, we'll finish up a program from Chapter 4: Stick Figure Adventure</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
There are two paths that currently end as "To Be Continued."  Choose one of 
those paths and extend it with at least two more scenes.  For each of your
new scene, find an image to represent it and store it in the directory of 
images.  You should have at least one decision in your new part
of your adventure.</p>

<p>
Hint:  You will find it easiest to use images that are already in the 
PNG format and name them after the scene they will appear in (e.g. <tt>scene10.png</tt>).
If you have an image that's not in PNG, you can convert it via several 
online programs.  Here's a partial list:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.piccyfix.com/">http://www.piccyfix.com/</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://snipshot.com/">http://snipshot.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Loops<br>
</h3>
<p>In lecture, we discussed two different types of loops: for loops and
while loops.  For each of the programs below, you can use either
type of loop you like:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a program that will display 10 different hues of
<b>blue</b>.  Note that in class we discussed a program that
displayed 10 different hues of red.</li>
  <li>Write a guessing game program that asks the user to guess your
secret number.  If they enter a number that's too low, tell them
so, and prompt them for another guess.  Similarly, if they enter a
number that's too high, tell them so, and prompt them for another
guess. When they guess the correct number, congratualate them.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
<p>Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.</p>

<h3>Logging Out</h3>
<p>Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.</p>
