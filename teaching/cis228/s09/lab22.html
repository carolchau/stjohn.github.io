<h2>Lab 22</h2>
<h3>CIS 228: The Internet <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2009<br><br>
</h3>
</div>


<div>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>Today's focus is events and validating forms.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Functions with Parameters
</h3>
<p>
First, create a new webpage that will display different messages when
different sections of the page have been clicked, using
the <tt>displayMessage()</tt> function from <a href="../functions.html">functions.html</a>.
On your new page, you should have at least
three elements that display messages when clicked.  None of your
three elements may be form buttons; instead, use images, divs, tables,
etc.  Each of the three elements should display a different
message.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Toggling Elements</h3>
<p>
Write a function called <tt>disappear</tt> that will make elements
of the page `disappear' from view.  The function 
should look like this:
</p>
<pre>
    // Makes the element with ID id no longer visible
    function disappear(id) {
    
       
    
    }
</pre>
<p>
Choose an existing page with at least three elements in it, and 
hook up your function to those elements using event handling
(i.e. <tt>onclick</tt>).
</p>
<p>
(Hint:  See the <a href="../annoyingWindow.html">annoying window</a>
page for how to make elements no longer visible.)
</p>
</div>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
