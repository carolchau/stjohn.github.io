<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.</p>
<p>
Today, we focus on finding bugs.

<h3>Donuts and Cookies</h3>

<p>The book develops the iRock and donut example in the first three chapters.  
We will use the files from Chapter 2 and 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch03.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjs/ch03.php</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Using the donut example as a base, modify the JavaScript to remember
the user's name when they return.  The simplest way to do this is to
mimic what was done for iRock.  Recall that the last version of the
iRock asks the user their name and stores it in cookie.
</p>
The steps that need to be done here:
<ul>
	<li> When the name changes, store it in a cookie (how can you tell 
		when a field changes?)
	<li> When the page loads, if the name is known, put it in the input
		field on the form (Hint: Look at the iRock example for checking
		if the cookie exists.  You will want to make this change when
		the onload event has been triggered-- use the &lt;body&gt; element.)
</ul>

<h3>Finding Bugs</h3>

<p>
An important part of programming is to be able to locate and fix bugs.
The goal of today's lab is to find (and fix!) all the bugs in the following
file:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="../donutBugs/donutsBugs.html">donutsBugs.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
This page should prompt a user for their name and the donuts and 
bagels they wish to purchase.  Currently, there are too many bugs
in the file for it to do this.
Using the error console in the Mozilla Firefox browser, find each
bug and fix it.  
</p>
<p>
Some useful things to remember when hunting for bugs:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> If you would like the graphics to appear and the style to look
		as before, save this file to the directory containing your donut
		page from before.
	<li> Bugs often occur the line above which the error console reports.
		So, look both at the line reported and the line above.
	<li> A single bug can cause multiple error messages.  So, fixing the
		first one reported on the error console will often get rid of 
		multiple error messages.
	<li>  Use the "clear" button on the error console between multiple
		runs of your program.  This will keep you from confusing old
		errors with the current ones.
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
