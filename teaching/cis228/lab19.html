<h1>Laboratory Exercise 19<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
28 November 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using loops.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two useful files from
lecture are the <a href="forLoops.html">for loop</a> examples and the <a
 href="whileLoops.html">while loop</a> examples.<br>
</p>
<h3>Loops<br>
</h3>
In lecture, we discussed two different types of loops: for loops and
while loops.&nbsp; For each of the programs below, you can use either
type of loop you like:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Modify the temperature table program to display the temperatures,
ranging from -100 to 100 degrees celsius, counting by tens (ie -100,
-90, -80,... , 80, 90, 100).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Write a program that will display 10 different hues of
blue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that in class we discussed a program that
displayed 10 different hues of red.</li>
  <li>Write a guessing game program that asks the user to guess your
secret number.&nbsp; If they enter a number that's too low, tell them
so, and prompt them for another guess.&nbsp; Similarly, if they enter a
number that's too high, tell them so, and prompt them for another
guess.&nbsp; When they guess the correct number, congratualate them.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
