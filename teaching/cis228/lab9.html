<h1>Laboratory Exercise 9<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
10 October 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet.&nbsp; We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.&nbsp;
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
<h3>Classes<br>
</h3>
Before starting the lounge exercises, you will need to
download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We'll start today by finishing up the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.html</span> from Chapter 8:
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Add classes to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.html</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.css</span> to make:<br
 clear="all">
    <ul>
      <li>the paragraph about green tea have green text.<br>
      </li>
      <li>the paragraph about raspberry elixir have blue text.</li>
      <li>the paragraph about blueberry elixir have purple text. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do the exercise on p 326.</li>
  <li>Validate your <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.css</span>
file using the CSS validator:<br clear="all">
    <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator</a>&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Fonts<br>
</h3>
Next, we're going to look at some basic style related to fonts.&nbsp;
We'll work with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
file in Chapter 9 (the segway
example, revisited):
<ol>
  <li>In the journal folder for Chapter 9, create a file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">journal.css</span> with:<br clear="all">
    <br clear="all">
    <tt>body { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif; <br
 clear="all">
}</tt><br clear="all">
    <tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt> </tt> </li>
  <li>Now, link your new file <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.css</span>
to <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span> and view
the results in a browser.</li>
  <li>Make the body font small (using keywords) and the h1 heading 150%
and h2 heading 120%.&nbsp; View your results in a browser to make sure
the font sizes have changed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>To make the headings stand out less, change the font-weight to
normal.</li>
  <li>Also, add italic font to quotes (i.e. add a rule to your CSS file
that says that all blockquotes should use italic).</li>
</ol>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
Due to the length of the lab, we won't be adding anything to the
all-about-me website this week.<br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
