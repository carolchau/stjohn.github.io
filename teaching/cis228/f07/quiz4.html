<h3>Blackboard</h3>
This
course will use the on-line Blackboard system for submitting work
electronically and on-line quizzes.&nbsp; Blackboard should be
accessible through your CUNY portal account (<a
 href="http://portal.cuny.edu/">http://portal.cuny.edu</a>).&nbsp; If
you have not used Blackboard in the past, information is available at
the Computer Center.&nbsp; They can set up your account and have
information sheets about using the system.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The topic for this quiz is Chapters 4 and 5 from <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Head First HTML</span>.&nbsp; As in the
last quiz, almost all questions come directly from the reading.&nbsp; A
good
way to prepare for this quiz is to do all the exercises from both
chapters.&nbsp; For Chapter 5 on images, we will not cover in class
transparency in images.&nbsp; You should read this section, as it does
appear in the quiz.&nbsp; As such, the emphasis of the quiz reflects
what we covered in class.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>

Note:&nbsp; If you do not like your initial grade, you may retake the
quiz to improve your grade.&nbsp; If the system times out and locks
your quiz attempt (happens rarely when the browser or PC crashes), send
me mail and I can clear the attempt so you can try again.<br>
