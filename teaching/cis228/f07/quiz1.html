<h3>Blackboard</h3>
This
course will use the on-line Blackboard system for submitting work
electronically and on-line quizzes.&nbsp; Blackboard should be
accessible through your CUNY portal account (<a
 href="http://portal.cuny.edu/">http://portal.cuny.edu</a>).&nbsp; If
you have not used Blackboard in the past, information is available at
the Computer Center.&nbsp; They can set up your account and have
information sheets about using the system.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The topic for this first quiz is the Academic Integrity Policy
(available <a href="../lsp350/acadPol.pdf">here</a>, or as part of the
Undergraduate Bulletin) and is very straightforward.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Note:&nbsp; If you do not like your initial grade, you may retake the
quiz to improve your grade.&nbsp; If the system times out and locks
your quiz attempt (happens rarely when the browser or PC crashes), send
me mail and I can clear the attempt so you can try again.<br>
