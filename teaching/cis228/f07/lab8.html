<h1>Laboratory Exercise 8<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
3 October 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet.&nbsp; We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.&nbsp;
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
<h3>Back to Style<br>
</h3>
Before starting the lounge exercises, you will need to
download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We're going to work with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.html</span>
file in Chapter 8 (the lounge
example, revisited).&nbsp; <br>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Add the style described in the book <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span> to change:<br
 clear="all">
    <ul>
      <li>the font in paragraphs to maroon</li>
      <li>make headings use sans-serif fonts in gray</li>
      <li>add underlining (bottom-border) to h1 headings<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now, move your style rules to a new page&nbsp; <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.css</span>, and link it to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.html</span>.</li>
  <li>Use the same set of style rules (ie link to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.css)</span>for <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">directions.html</span>, and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">exilir.html</span>.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
Create a style sheet for your website with at least 3 rules.&nbsp; Link
three or more of your pages to the style sheet, as you did for the
lounge site.&nbsp; <br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
