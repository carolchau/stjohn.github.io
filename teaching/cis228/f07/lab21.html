<h1>Laboratory Exercise 21<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
5 December 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using cookies to store information after the
browser has exited or has reloaded the page.&nbsp; In lecture, we also
discussed how dates and times are stored in JavaScript and the use of
innerHTML() to set values on a webpage.<br>
</p>
<h3>Timing Visits<br>
</h3>
In the <a href="cookie.html">cookie.html</a> file, we displayed the
number of previous visits to the page.&nbsp; Add an additional
&lt;span&gt; element that says the last time you visited the
page.&nbsp; (Hint:&nbsp; add an additional cookie to hold the date when
you last visited).<br>
<h3>Using Dates<br>
</h3>
Write a javaScript function that displays the current date on the top
of the webpage.&nbsp; This program does not use cookies but does use
the other topics discussed in lecture: the Date object and innerHTML()
function.&nbsp; To break this program into steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create (or reuse from a previous lab) an HTML file with a heading
section on the top.&nbsp; The heading should be a unique div with id of
"heading".</li>
  <li>Write a (very short) JavaScript function that gets the current
date (hint:&nbsp; see setCookie() function in <a href="cookie.html">cookie.html</a>)
and then sets the #heading div to that value (hint: see updateCount()
function in <a href="cookie.html">cookie. html</a>).</li>
  <li>Your JavaScript function should be called whenever the page is
reloaded (hint: &lt;body onload="..."&gt;).<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
