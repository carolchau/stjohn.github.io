<h1>Laboratory Exercise 13<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
24 October 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet.&nbsp; We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.&nbsp;
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
<h3>Layouts<br>
</h3>
Before starting the lounge exercises, you will need to
download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We'll finish today with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">journal.html</span>
from Chapter 9.&nbsp; The overall goal is to style Tony's Segway page
with navigation on the side (like you see in a blog). &nbsp;
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Create a sidebar with links to the entries in his journal.&nbsp;
For example, the first link should be to the entry for August 20, the
next link for the entry on July 14.&nbsp; Use the id attribute to
create anchors in the page (see p 153 for a review).<br>
  </li>
  <li>The sidebar should be to the right, below the title of the
page.&nbsp; Use any page layout or rules you wish to place it there.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The main part of the page and the sidebar should each have
borders around them and different background colors.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<tt><br>
</tt>
<ol>
</ol>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
Take your schedule page from before, and add a fixed element with a
link to the Lehman College course schedules.&nbsp; This element should
stay in the same place, no matter if the text in the main window is
scrolled up and down.&nbsp; See the "free coffee coupon" example in
Chapter 12 as a guideline.&nbsp; Your page must have:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A fixed element with a link to the Lehman College course
schedule.&nbsp; Your link can be words or an image.</li>
  <li>If the link is an image, remove any borders (ie use
pseudoclasses).&nbsp; If the link is words, color the section
differently, so it stands out from the background of the main section
of your page.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
