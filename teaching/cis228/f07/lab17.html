<h1>Laboratory Exercise 17<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
19 November 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet.&nbsp; We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.&nbsp;
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
<h3>Using Variables<br>
</h3>
First, let's write a simple program that uses variables.&nbsp; Write a
webpage that uses JavaScript to <br>
<ol>
  <li>first, ask the user for a number and <br>
  </li>
  <li>then tells the user the
square of that number <br>
  </li>
</ol>
For example, if the user enters 2, you say 4; if the user
enters 3, you say 9.<br>
<h3>Arithmetic in JavaScript<br>
</h3>
<ol>
</ol>
In lecture, we wrote a calculator for determining the letter grade
given the numerical score.&nbsp; In lab, we'll write a calculator that
takes a decimal number and outputs its hexadecimal code.&nbsp; To make
things simpler,<br>
we will only convert numbers that are &lt; 16.&nbsp; The basic outline
of the program is:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Prompt the user for a number.</li>
  <li>If the number is &gt;= 16, display a message saying the number is
too large for our calculator.</li>
  <li>If the number &lt;=15, print out the single digit hexadecimal for
that number<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Since there's lots of steps to this, let's break it up into
subproblems, detailed in the sections that follow:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Print and Display:&nbsp;</span>
To start, first make a program that prompts the user for a number and
just prints out that same number to the screen (this is to check that
your variables are set up right).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Numbers That Are Too Big:</span>&nbsp;
Next, add in a test if the number is bigger than 15.&nbsp; If so, print
out a message saying so.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Small Numbers:&nbsp;</span> if
the number is &lt;=9, then you can just print out the number (since
numbers that small are the same in hexadecimal or decimal).&nbsp; Add
in a test for this, and test to make sure it works.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Converting the Rest:&nbsp;</span>
Next, if the number is 10, print out "A" (add a test for this).&nbsp;
If the number is 11, print out "B" (add a test for this).&nbsp; Repeat
with the numbers upto 15.&nbsp; In the end, you'll have several tests,
one for each of the numbers between 10 and 15.&nbsp; Test to make sure
this works.</li>
</ul>
In a future lab, we'll use this work to convert larger hexadecimal
numbers.<br>
<br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
