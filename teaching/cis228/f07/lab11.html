<h1>Laboratory Exercise 11<br>
</h1>
<h2>CIS 228: The Internet<br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
17 October 2007</h2>
<hr>
<h3>General Information &amp; Getting Started<br>
</h3>
<p>See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more details on getting
started and the rules for the
lab.<br>
</p>
<p>Today's focus is using connections to the internet.&nbsp; We will
talk briefly about creating your own domain and all that entails.&nbsp;
We will spend the majority of the lab on linking to URLs, absolute
paths, and fun uses of the &lt;a&gt; element like popping up new
windows, adding titles, and creating destinations. <br>
</p>
<h3>divs<br>
</h3>
Before starting the lounge exercises, you will need to
download the
files provided on
the book's webpage to a floppy drive or USB keychain.&nbsp; If you
haven't already done so, the book's
website is:
<blockquote><a href="http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php">http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/index.php</a><br>
</blockquote>
We'll start today with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.html</span>
from Chapter 11:
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>Add a &lt;div&gt; element to the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.html</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">lounge.css</span>:<br
 clear="all">
    <ul>
      <li>the identifier (id) should be elixirs and contain the elixir
menu,<br>
      </li>
      <li>the menu should have width 200 pixels, a thin solid border,
centered text, and 20 pixels of padding on all sides but the top.<br>
      </li>
      <li>further, use the background image, placing it in the upper
left hand corner and having it repeat exactly once<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next, using descendant selectors, change the color of the
headings inside the elixirs section only:<br clear="all">
    <ul>
      <li>the &lt;h1&gt; headings should be black, and <br>
      </li>
      <li>the &lt;h2&gt; headings should be red<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>All-About-Me Website<br>
</h3>
Make a new page, based on your favorite places page, called <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">travel.html</span>, and an associated
style file, <span style="font-family: monospace;">travel.css</span>.&nbsp;
This page should have at least two places, consisting of a heading,
paragraph, and image.&nbsp; Using the &lt;div&gt; element, divide each
place into its own logical section.&nbsp; Place a border around each
section and change the background color and text color to complement
the image chosen for that section. <br>
<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>
Show your webpages to Professor St. John, before leaving the lab
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Logging Out</h3>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer. Remember to pick up any files you sent to the
printer
and to take any personal belongings. It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
