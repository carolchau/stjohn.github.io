    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Head First HTML with CSS
&amp; XHTML</span> by Freeman and Freeman, ISBN-1-:0-596-10197X<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul>
      <li>Computer Laboratory Exercises: 15%<br>
      </li>
      <li>Written Work and Quizzes: 20%</li>
      <li>Midterm Exam 1: 20% <br>

      <li>Midterm Exam 2: 20%<br>
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Computer Laboratory
Exercises:&nbsp;</span> Laboratory exercises are posted on the class
website, usually the week before class.&nbsp; They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture and should be completed within 3 weeks of the
original laboratory.&nbsp; Note that as the semester progresses, the
exercises will take design and programming outside of class to
complete.&nbsp; To receive credit for an laboratory exercise, you must
demonstrate the HTML page and the associated programs,
and explain how
they work.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Written Work &amp; Quizzes:</b> There will be written
homework and quizzes based on the readings and lectures for
class.&nbsp; We will use the on-line
Blackboard system for both written exercises and quizzes.&nbsp; You can
resubmit written homework and quizzes for regrading within 3 weeks of
the original due date.&nbsp; See the course webpage for more details
about homework and quizzes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exams</span><b>:</b>&nbsp;
There will be two midterm exams and a final exam for this course.&nbsp;
The midterm exams are:&nbsp; <br clear="all">
    <ul>
      <li>Wednesday, 26 September</li>
      <li>Wednesday, 7 November</li>
    </ul>
Since the final is comprehensive, if you do better on it than on one of
the midterm exams, the score on the final may replace one of the
midterm scores. Note that the final will be long and difficult, so, it
is an exceptionally bad idea to plan on taking advantage of this. There
will be no makeup exams, and you must pass the final to pass the
class.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own.&nbsp; You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's <a
 href="acadPol.pdf">academic integrity code</a> (available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). <br>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. </li>
  <li> <b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories.&nbsp; These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus.&nbsp; Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.&nbsp; <br>
