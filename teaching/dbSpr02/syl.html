There will be no makeup exams, and you must		pass the final to pass the class.	</li><li> <b>Assignments:</b> 		Homework assignments are posted on the class website.		These are not to be turned in but are the subject of		the quizzes.  More information about the quizzes can be		found <a href="quiz1.html">here</a>.		<br>		Lab programs should be turned in the day of the lab.		The deadline for turning in a program is usually several		weeks after the lab and is on the top of every lab.		No program will be accepted after the last laboratory 		session of the semester.  If you wish to improve a grade 		on any program, you may resubmit it for grading.		<br>		Full credit will only be given for those programs that		run correctly and have good documentation and		programming style.	</li><li> <b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the		overall design of the programs and homework.
