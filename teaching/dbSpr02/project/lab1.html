<h1>Laboratory Exercise 1</h1>
<h2>CMP 420: Database Systems<br> 
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
14 February 2002</h2>

<hr>
<h3>General Information About the Lab</h3>

The machines in this lab run RedHat Linux 7.0 with KDE.  
Linux is a variant of the unix operating system designed to 
run on Pentium systems.  The student accounts use the KDE
window manager, one of many different choices for the 
"the look and feel" of the user interface.  The directions
below are specific to our systems and might not generalize
to other systems (for example, those in other labs on 
campus or your home machines).  See the section at the 
end of this lab for working outside the lab.

<p>
The department has the following policies for
the lab:
<ul>
	<li> There is no eating or drinking in the
		lab.
	<li> Due to restricted class sizes, children
		are not allowed in the computer labs.
	<li> Do not waste paper-- only print files
		that directly relate to the class.
	<li> Do not enter the lab until the scheduled
		class time.  If the lab is open 
		before class time, it is because
		another class is using it or for
		maintenance.
	<li> Always log out and turn off the monitor
		when you leave the lab.
</ul>



<h3>Getting Started</h3>

First, turn on the computer-- the button is
in the front.  The monitor should also come on, if it doesn't,
the button for it is also in the front.  It will take a few moments 
for the computer to get started.  You will then see a RedHat logo
on the left hand side of the screen, and the words <tt>linux</tt>
and <tt>win</tt> in a white box on the right.  Choose <tt>linux</tt>
and hit return.  These machines are "dual-boot," with both Linux
and Windows.  By choosing <tt>linux</tt>, the machine will boot up 
under the Linux operating system.  This will take a little bit and
you will see many system messages scroll by.

<p>
When the computer is ready, you will see a login screen.  Type the
login and password given to you in lab.  This will be your account
for the semester and will also work if you would like to log directly
into <tt>comet</tt> from home.  These accounts will be deleted at the
end of the semester.  Any student wishing a permanent unix account
should inquire about an alpha account at the Information Technology
Resource Center.

<p>
Click on the terminal icon to bring up a new terminal window (it
has a picture of computer on it and is located either on the left
hand side of the screen or in the tool bar).  In this window, 
type:
<pre>
    yppasswd
</pre>
You will then be asked to type your password, along with a new 
password.  For your password, you should choose at least 6 characters,
including at least one non-alphabetic character, and you should 
choose a password not based on a word in the dictionary.  Choose
something you can remember since if you forget your password, it
can only be reset from Mondays to Thursday from 9-4.

<h3>Some Basic Commands</h3>

You can start and control programs either by using their graphical
interface or at a terminal window.  For example, you can start 
Netscape by <b>single clicking</b> on the netscape icon, or by 
launching it from the terminal window by typing <tt>netscape</tt>.  

<p>
Here are some basic commands in unix:
<ul>
   <li> <tt>ls</tt> lists all files in your directory
   <li> <tt>cd sampledir</tt> changes the current directory to 
	<tt>sampledir</tt>.
   <li> <tt>lpr -Ppr219 filename</tt> prints the file filename to
	the printer in the lab.  You can only print while in the 
	lab and not from a remote location.          
   <li> <tt>w</tt> shows all users currently on your system
   <li> <tt>hostname</tt> tells the name of the machine you're logged
	onto.
   <li> <tt>telnet comet</tt> logs you into the server comet
</ul>

<p>
All the user accounts have been created on the server <tt>comet</tt>
and the <tt>/home</tt> filesystem is remotely mounted using NFS.
There are no accounts created locally on any of the workstations.
Because of this and the fact that these machines are dual booting
systems and they are turned off, you will only be able to send mail out 
of these workstations.  All mail should be addressed as follows:
<pre>
    username@comet.lehman.cuny.edu
</pre>
To read your mail from these workstations, you will have to telnet
to <tt>comet</tt> and retrieve your mail.

<p>
All files for web pages should be placed in the <tt>public_html</tt>
directory located inside your directory.  The home page should be
named <tt>index.html</tt>.  The URL for each account is:
<pre>
http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/username
</pre>

<p>
The dial up phone numbers are: 960-7278 and 960-7279.  On the menu
choose number 4 for comet.

<h3>Some Basic Database Commands</h3>

We will be using the PostgreSQL database package for Linux.
It follows the client/server architecture discussed in class.
There are several different "front-ends" for the user to 
interact with the server.  Today, we will work with one  
developed by Great Bridge, called pgaccess.

<p>
First, telnet into comet by typing
<pre>
telnet comet
</pre>
This is necessary, since most, but not all of the software
on comet is available directly in the lab. 
Next, type
<pre>
createdb MYNAMElab1
</pre>
where <tt>MYNAME</tt> is your name.  This will create a
database for today's lab.

<p>
Now, type
<pre>
pgaccess MYNAMElab1
</pre>
This will launch a graphical interface for modifying your
database.  Select the <b>Tables</b> tab on the left, and
then click on <b>New</b>.  This will bring up a window
that allows you to create a new table.  Enter the <tt>Movie</tt>
database from p 99 of the textbook.  You will first need to
enter the name of the table (<tt>movie</tt>), then the 
attributes, or fields, choosing the type of the field as
you go.  Choose <tt>char</tt> for the type of <tt>filmType</tt>
When you are done entering fields, click the <tt>create</tt>
button in the bottom right hand corner.

<p>
Now that the table has been created, click on the <b>Open</b>
button to open it, and enter the rows from p 99 into your
table.  When you're done, close the table.  

<p>
Choose the <b>Queries</b> tab and click on the <b>New</b>
button.  This will launch an SQL window.  Type in the 
following query:
<pre>
    SELECT title
    FROM "Movie"
</pre>
Execute the query, and you should see the titles of the movies
in the table.

<p>
You can also build queries using the Query Builder, which can
be accessed by choosing  the <tt>Visual Designer</tt> button 
from the new query window.  The query builder allows you to
select the table (you need to highlight it with the mouse), 
and drag the fields you are interested to the grid on the
bottom.  You can show and execute the corresponding SQL command
with the buttons on top.  Build the simple query above, using
the query builder.  How does the SQL it generates differ from
that you typed above?

<p>
Write queries that will do the following:
<ol>
    <li> Find the actors in "Star Wars."
    <li> Find all films made after 1990.
    <li> Find the length of the shortest film (this should be 
	a query that will still work, even more rows are added
	to the table).
</ol>

<h3>Design Your Own Database</h3>

If you finish the lab early, you can use the time to begin designing
your project database, described below.  More information about the
project can be found on the <a href="project/">project webpage</a>.

<p>
As the course progresses you will be building a substantial database
application for a real-world scenario of your choosing. You will
design a relational schema for the database, and you will create
an actual database using a relational database management system.
You will populate the database with sample data, write interactive
queries and modifications on the database, and develop user-friendly
tools for manipulating the database.  For ideas on possible databases,
see the book's webpage.

<p>
Your first step is to identify the domain you would like to manage
with your database, and to construct an entity-relationship diagram
for the data. Pick an application that you will
enjoy working with, since you'll be stuck with it for the rest of
the semester.

<p>
Try to pick an application that is relatively substantial, but not
too enormous. For example, when expressed in the entity-relationship
model, you might want your design to have in the range of five or so
entity sets, and a similar number of relationships. Note that this
is a ballpark figure only! You should certainly include different
kinds of relationships (e.g., many-one, many-many) and different
kinds of data (strings, integers, etc.), but your application is not
required to use advanced features, such as subclassing, multiway
relationships, or weak entity sets, if they are not appropriate
for your application.

<p>

The following are part of the project and are due on 
Thursday, 21 February in lab.  See the <a href="project/">project
page</a> for more details.</font>

<ul>
    <li> Describe the database application you propose to work
    with throughout the course. Your description should be brief
    and relatively informal. If there are any unique or particularly
    difficult aspects of your proposed application, please point
    them out. Your description will be graded only on suitability
    and conciseness.

    <li> Specify an entity-relationship diagram for your
    proposed database. Don't forget to underline key
    attributes and include arrowheads indicating the multiplicity of
    relationships. If there are weak entity sets, indicate them by
    double lines, as described in class.
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Your Lab</h3>

Show your database, queries, and individual database to 
Professor St. John, before leaving the lab today.

<h3>Logging Out</h3>

Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut
down your computer.  First, you should quit all 
applications.  Then, go to the <tt>K</tt> menu in 
the bottom left hand corner and select <tt>Log Out</tt>.
Choose the <tt>Shut Down</tt> option, and shut off the
monitor when you're done.

<p>
Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer
and to take any personal belongings.  It is difficult
to get back into the lab later (since it's locked when
not in use), so, it's worth making sure you haven't
forgotten anything.
