<h2>Suggested Problems</h2>

These are not to be turned in.  They are to help you understand
the material, and some will appear on the quiz and exams.

<ul>
	<li> Exercise 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.
	<li> Exercise 2.1.9.
	<li> Exercise 2.2.1.
	<li> Exercise 2.2.3.
	<li> Exercises 2.2.6 and 2.2.7.
	<li> (from Ullman's DB course, Fall 2000):
	In this exercise, you will model the database of an ``eTailer,'' 
	such as Amazon. Here are the kinds of information that the eTailer 
	wishes to maintain: 
	<ul>
            <li> Their suppliers, including supplier names, addresses, 
	    and a logo to display. 

            <li> The items made by each supplier (e.g., HP),
            including the type of item (e.g., printer), the model
            number (e.g., 693C), and the retail price. Note that
            different suppliers may use the same model number for
            different items, even if those items are of the same type
            and price. However, one supplier will not use the same
            model number for two different items.

            <li> Customers, including their name, address, and email. 

            <li> Credit cards, including the company (e.g., Visa),
            number, and expiration date. Each customer may
            have several credit cards on file, but each credit card
            belongs to only one customer.

            <li> Orders. Each order has a unique ID, has a single
            customer who placed the order. One of the
            customer's credit cards was used to pay for the order,
            and the order must tell which. A customer can place several
            orders and use different credit cards for each. An order is
            for some set of items, and their is an associated quantity
            for each. There are several ways to represent orders,
            but try to use a design that does not allow an order to be
            placed for a customer who does not own the credit card used
            to pay for the order.
	</ul>

    	Give an E/R design for this database. Briefly explain your
    	reasoning, including the intuitive meaning of any relationships
    	you use and any entity sets you use other than suppliers, items,
    	customers, and orders.  

<!-- To be done later, after keys and weak entity sets are explained:
	Do not forget to indicate keys, many-one
    	relationships, and weak entity sets in the appropriate ways.
-->


</ul>
