<h3>Announcements:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="hw6.html">Homework 6</a> is now available.  It
    	relies on several chapters from Abiteboul, Hull, and 
	Vianu, which are available from Halaulani, in the
	department office.

    <li> Some of the more bizarre system problems this semester:
    <ul>
    	<li> Passwords that are longer than 8 characters are allowed
		on <font color="grey">onyx</font> but cause 
		problems when propagated to the linux boxes.<br>
		Solution: Use shorter passwords.
	<li> The informix scripts count on undefined shell variables
		being intepreted as null. <br>
		Solution: Remove the line:
		<pre>set -u</pre>
		from your .profile.  This line is included in the 
		default .profile that comes with your account.
	<li> Running the database gives a read error when trying to
		connect.<br>
		Solution: This problem is related to the setup of
		Informix on our system.  We're using NFS to share
		onyx's disk between the linux boxes (and thus 
		avoiding maintaining 5 separate copies of Informix).
    </ul>

    <li> There are some problems with Homework 4. Thanks to John for
    	pointing them out!.  Most are small (but very annoying)
	and involve idiosyncrasies with this version of Informix.
	A <a href="hw4.html">new version</a> of the homework is 
	now available.
	My apologies for those
	of you who have struggled through the problems!<br>
	<font color="red">The deadline for the Homework will be extended until 
	midnight, Friday, 9 April.</font>

    <li> Informix SQL is now available on the linux machines
    	in MG216.  Here's some <a href="isql.html">directions</a>
	on how to use it.  I'm still writing up some extra
	instructions on installing it on your own linux system
	(the beginning of it is <a href="isql.html">here</a>).
	
</ul>
