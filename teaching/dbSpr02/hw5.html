<b>W14.</b>  Describe the database application you propose to work
    with throughout the course. Your description should be brief
    and relatively informal. If there are any unique or particularly
    difficult aspects of your proposed application, please point
    them out. Your description will be graded only on suitability
    and conciseness.  (See <a href="lab1.html">Lab 1</a> for more
    details about what is required.)

<p>
<b>W15.</b> Specify an entity-relationship diagram for your
    proposed database. As always, don't forget to underline key
    attributes and include arrowheads indicating the multiplicity of
    relationships. If there are weak entity sets, indicate them by
    double lines, as described in class.
