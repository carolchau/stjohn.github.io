<h3>Exam 1</h3>

<ol>
    <li> <tt>
	In exam rule you said that an A4 piece of paper is allowed 
	filled with notes etc Question - Can the notes fill both 
	sides of the paper or just one side?
	</tt> 

	<p>
	You can use both sides of the paper for notes.
        <p>

    <li><tt>can you send me the answers for question 9 & 10 for the 
	example exam you have on your webpage?(exam 1 given by prof 
	St john)
	</tt>
	<p>
	Problem 9 is just definitions from the textbook.  I can type 
	them in for you, but they'll be easier to read from the textbook.

	<p>
	Problem 10:  Given the relation schema R(A,B,C,D) with the 
	functional dependencies: AB->C, BC->D, CD->A, and AD->B.  

	<p>
	a) Indicate all the BCNF violations:

	<p>
	First, find the closures of each subset of attributes.
	Note that the closure of the singletons are just the singletons:<br>
		A+ = A, B+ = B, C+ = C, and D+ = D.<br>
	For the subsets of size two, break into two groups: those who are
	the left hand side of a functional dependency (those turn out to
	be keys) and the rest whose closure are themselves:<br>
		AB+ = BC+ = CD+ = AD+ = all attributes<br>
		AC+ = AC, BD+ = BD.<br>
	The subsets of size three are all extensions of the keys of
	size two (ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD) are superkeys.

	<p>
	So, for each of the functional dependencies above, the left
	hand side is a key, so they are all in BCNF.

	<p>
	The question also says to consider the derived dependencies, that
	is all functional dependencies that follow from the ones given.
	Note that any derived functional dependency must start with a
	left hand side of those given.  Since the left hand sides are all
	keys, any derived key must also be in BCNF.

	<p>
	b) Decompose the relations, as necessary, into a collection of relations
	that are in BCNF.

	<p>
	R is in BCNF, so, no decomposition is needed.
