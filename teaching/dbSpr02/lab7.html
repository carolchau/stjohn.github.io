<h2>System Aspects of SQL</h2>

<h3>Privileges</h3>

In lecture, we discussed how to grant privileges to other users
(see Ullman's <a href=ullmanSlidesF00/slides13.ps>slides13.ps</a>).
The syntax for granting privileges in postgreSQL is described
at <a href="http://www.us.postgresql.org/users-lounge/docs/6.5/user/sql-grant.htm">http://www.us.postgresql.org/users-lounge/docs/6.5/user/sql-grant.htm</a>.

<p>
Following the user's guide, 
<ol>
    <li> grant delete privilege to the <tt>companies</tt> table to
	the person sitting next to you.
    <li> grant insert privilege to the <tt>orders</tt> table to
	everyone.
    <li> grant update privileges on only <tt>co_name</tt> 
	(from the table <tt>companies</tt>) to <tt>ks27</tt><br>
	(Hint: since privileges can only be granted for entire tables,
	think about how to create a virtual table with just co_name.)
</ol>
How do you show that the privileges have changed?

<p>
How do you remove privileges?  How would you remove deleting privileges
on <tt>companies</tt> from your neighbor?

<h3>Final Comments</h3>

If you have extra time, use it to work on your project.

<p>
Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut down your
computer.  First, you should quit all applications.  Then,
go to the <tt>K</tt> menu in the bottom left hand corner and
select <tt>Log Out</tt>.  Choose the <tt>Shut Down</tt> option,
and shut off the monitor when you're done.

<p>
Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer and to
take any personal belongings.  It is difficult to get back
into the lab later (since it's locked when not in use), so,
it's worth making sure you haven't forgotten anything.

<p>
Also, remember to turn in Homework 8 and the first part of your
project before leaving!

<p>
Next lab, we will focus on designing and compiling Java
programs on an Unix platform.  If you haven't programmed in
Java in sometime, you should review how to write a program that
instantiates objects and has a graphical user interface (GUI).
