<h1>Laboratory Exercise 6</h1>
<h2>Using SQL with Java</h2>
<h2>CMP 420: Database Systems<br> 
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
15 November 2001</h2>

<hr>

To embed SQL commands inside a Java program, we're using the JDBC 
interface.  You can find the API's for JDBC at Sun's 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jdbc/index.html">webpage</a>.
To use the JDBC interface, you first have to make sure that your
java programs can find the java archive that contains the file
(that is, set the path to find the .jar file).  Then, you need to 
implicitly load the driver, before issuing SQL commands.

<h3>Setting up your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt></h3>

First, locate the java archive file for JDBC, by typing:
<pre>
    locate jdbc | grep jar
</pre>
What's the full name of the .jar file?  What is the complete path
to the file?

<p>
Next, we need to include the .jar in the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>,
or places to look for the libraries or archives used by the program.
To make sure that the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> is set whenever you log on, 
you can set it in the <tt>.bash_profile</tt>, which is executed 
whenever you open a new terminal window. 
To do this, edit the <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and add the lines:
<pre>
    CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/pgsql/jdbc6.5-1.2.jar:.
    export CLASSPATH
</pre>
The `.' at the end of the CLASSPATH says to also look in the current
directory for classes.  The <tt>export</tt> statement means that the
environment variable will continue to exist after the file has finished
executing.

<p>
To immediately put the changes in to effect that you entered in 
your <tt>.bash_profile</tt>, type at the command line:
<pre>
    source .bash_profile
</pre>
To check that it was successful, print the environment variables,
searching (or "grepping") for the ones that include the word PATH:
<pre>
    printenv | grep PATH
</pre>
You should see two different path variables-- one for locating 
executable programs and one for loading classes into java.  


<h3>Loading the <tt>driver</tt> class</h3>

The file <a href="TestDB.java">TestDB.java</a> is
a simple java program that includes the <tt>import</tt> statement
and java command for loading the necessary driver.  Compile it,
and make sure it runs (if it does, it will say "Test successful").

<p>
Whenever you use SQL statements in your java program, you will have
to include these two commands.  Note that the <tt>forName</tt>
method could throw a <tt>ClassNotFoundException</tt> and must be 
caught and handled.

<h3>Connecting to the Database</h3>

Before you can issue query and update commands, you first must
say which database you would like to use.  This is equivalent to
giving the name of the database when you launch <tt>psql</tt>
(for example, <tt>psql testDB</tt>).  To connect to a database, 
you need to specify the name of the database (prefaced by the 
interface names: "jdbc:postgresql:"), your username, and the
password (since we have not yet used password protection on the
databases, we use the word "pass" for this argument).  For example,
to connect to the database <tt>myDB</tt>, as user <tt>testPerson</tt>,
with no password, you would have the following command:
<pre>
    Connection db = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql:myDB", 
                                                "testPerson", "pass");
</pre>
Note that this method, as well as the ones in the next section,
can throw <tt>SQLExceptions</tt> that must be caught and handled.

<p>
Modify the java program from the previous section to connect to 
the database you created for Lab 2.

<h3>Query Statements in Java</h3>

To query the database, you first need a <tt>Statement</tt> object
(you can reuse it for later statements) and an object of type
<tt>ResultSet</tt> to hold the results of your query.  For example,
the following would print out the company names from your database:
<pre>
    Statement st = db.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select co_name from companies");
    System.out.println("Company Name");
    while(rs.next()) {
       System.out.println(rs.getString(1));
    }
    rs.close();
    st.close();
</pre>
These statements could throw an <tt>SQLException</tt> that must be
caught and handled.

<p>
Modify your java program to print out the company names from the
database.

<h3>Update Statements in Java</h3>

To update the database (or execute any statement that doesn't return
results), you use the <tt>executeUpdate()</tt> method of the 
<tt>Statement</tt> class.  For example, if you wanted to create 
a new table, <tt>t</tt> with two attributes, one an integer and
one for time, you use the following statement:
<pre>
    st.executeUpdate("create table t(id int4, date timestamp);");
</pre>
For example, to insert new values into the table, you could
use the following statements:
<pre>
   st.executeUpdate("insert into t values(3, now());");
   st.executeUpdate("insert into t values(2, now());");
</pre>
These statements could throw an <tt>SQLException</tt> that must be
caught and handled.

<h3>Java Programs for this Lab</h3> 

At the command line, create a database for this lab.  

<p>
Write a java program that creates 2 tables:
<pre>
     Courses(Dept, Number, Title, Credits, Hours);
     Offerings(CourseID, Dept, Number, Days, Room, Building, Instructor);
</pre>
And adds at least 25 entries to the first table and 100 entries to the
second.  Do not type these by hand, instead download part of
the <a href="http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/registrar/fall2001/schedf01.html">Fall
2001</a> schedule into a file.  Note that the schedule has a standardized
form, so, you can write a program that filters the schedule and produces
the SQL/Java statements you need.

<p>
Write another program that prints out the number of credit hours each
instructor is teaching.

<h3>Final Comments</h3>

Before leaving the lab, you need to log out and shut down your
computer.  First, you should quit all applications.  Then,
go to the <tt>K</tt> menu in the bottom left hand corner and
select <tt>Log Out</tt>.  Choose the <tt>Shut Down</tt> option,
and shut off the monitor when you're done.

<p>
Remember to pick up any files you sent to the printer and to
take any personal belongings.  It is difficult to get back
into the lab later (since it's locked when not in use), so,
it's worth making sure you haven't forgotten anything.

<p>
Also, remember to turn in Homework 8 and the first part of your
project before leaving!

<p>
Next lab, we will focus on designing and compiling Java
programs on an Unix platform.  If you haven't programmed in
Java in sometime, you should review how to write a program that
instantiates objects and has a graphical user interface (GUI).
