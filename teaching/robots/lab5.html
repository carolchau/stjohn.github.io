<h3>Random Walks</h3>

<p>
Today's lab uses the random number generator to make your 
robot take a random walk.  Random walks are used in mathematics and 
physics to model physical phenomena. 

<p><b>Design requirements:</b>  This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C.  Further, each 
motor is attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.).  No light or touch sensor is needed.  Your robot
should be able to hold a piece of chalk or pen.

<p><b>Programs used:</b> Today's lab uses
<a href="pirouette.nqc">pirouette.nqc</a>.

<p><b>Lab Set-up:</b> The lab assumes that there's small (5 by 5
square), medium (7 by 7 square), and large (10 by 10 square) 
box, traced out by tape outside of the lab.  The robots
will start in the middle of the box, and traces out a random walk
in the box.  Each robot should be holding a piece of chalk, or, if
paper is available to cover the box, a crayon or pen. 

<h3>Battery Life</h3>

Load the <a href="pirouette.nqc">pirouette.nqc</a> and adjust the
<tt>TURN_TIME</tt> so that your robot turns 360 degrees.  This time
will probably have changed from the last time you ran the program
due to change in battery strength.

<h3>Step Function</h3>

Write a function, <tt>step()</tt> that will generate a random number
between 0 and 3, and take a single step, in one of four directions:
<ul>
   <li> if the number is 0: one step in the direction you're already going
   <li> if the number is 1: turn 90 degrees and take one step
   <li> if the number is 2: turn 180 degrees and take one step
   <li> if the number is 3: turn 270 degrees and take one step
</ul>
A step should cover 6 inches or a single square of tile on the 
flooway outside.  Check with the TA for the size of a "step" for
the boxes set up outside.

<h3>Tracing Your Path</h3>

Add a mount to your robot to hold a piece of chalk (or pen, if 
there's paper available for the boxes).  Using a simple program 
like <a href="guidenqc/tankbot1.nqc">tankbot1.nqc</a>, test to make
sure the chalk marks a line and stays in place.

<h3>Random Walks</h3>

Using the <tt>step()</tt> function from above, write a program
that will take a random walk of 20 steps.  Starting at the middle
of the small box, does your robot leave the box?  Run your program
5 times.  How many of those runs left the box?  

<p>
How many steps does it take to make it out of the small box?
The medium box?  The large box?  There is a mathematical theorem
that predicts how many steps it should take given the dimensions
of the box.  Can you figure out the predicted number by running
experiments with your robot?

<h3>Extra Activities</h3>

If you finish early, you can work on your project.
