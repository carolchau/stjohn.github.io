	<li> Log on to a computer in the lab, using the account
		given to you this morning.
	<li> Launch the Netscape browser (this can be done from
		the icon bar or by typing <tt>netscape</tt> in
		a terminal window).
	<li> Bring up the course webpage:
		<a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/legos">
		http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/legos</a>
		and print out the information for 
		<a href="techtrip.html">the trip to the Tech museum</a>.
	<li> Bring up the Tech Museum's webpage: 
		<a href="http://www.techmuseum.org/">http://www.techmuseum.org</a>.
	<li> While at the Tech Museum, you must visit attend a
		special program, in addition to the "Meet Laika and Chip,
		the Robot Dogs" and "Peanut Butter and
		Jelly Robot" programs.  Choose one of the 
		daily programs and tours that looks interesting to
		you, and fill it in, along with its location, on the 
		information sheet you printed.
	<li> While at the Tech website, look up the Robot Zoo
		(under the Online Exhibits).
		Choose one of the animals (under the "Who's in the
		Zoo?" list on the right side of the page).  A Lego
		Mindstorms robot comes with 2 motors, 2 touch sensors,
		and a light sensor.  Examine the schematics of your 
		animal.  
		<ul>
		    <li> How many motors does the robot use?<br><br>
		    <li> How many touch sensors?  <br><br>
		    <li> How many light sensors?  	<br><br>
		    <li> Does it use additional sensors that are
			not found in the Lego Mindstorms kit?<br><br>
		</ul>
	<li> Also on the Online Exhibits page is a list of 
		Revolutionaries.  Choose one of them, read the
		interview, and then print and complete the 
		puzzle.  (Note: most, but not all, have puzzles.
		Choose one that has a puzzle listed in its 
		icon bar).
