<h3>Making Goals</h3>

The goal of today's lab is to move a small object or ball from the
starting zone to the target (or goal).  Your robot should push the
ball into the goal, kick the ball (take a running start at the ball),
but should not lift the ball from the ground.

<p><b>Design requirements:</b>  This lab assumes that the two motors
are wired to output ports A and C.  Further, each motor is attached
to a means of locomotion (legs, treads, feet, etc.).  The touch sensor
is wired to sensor port 1 and is attached to a bumper that pushes
the ball.  The light sensor is wired to sensor port 2 and used to
track colored tape on the ground.

<p><b>Programs used:</b> Today's lab uses <a
href="guidenqc/linebot1.nqc">linebot1.nqc</a>, and the line following
programs written for the <a href="lab3.html">lab 3</a>.

<p><b>Lab set-up:</b> The lab should have a small soccer goal set up
with radial paths of tape leading into the goal.  They should be marked
with contrasting stripes of take to signal the robots when they've 
reached the goal, and when to shoot the ball.  You may want to set
this all up in the children's swimming pool, used in 
<a href="lab4.html">lab 4</a>.

<h3>Dribbling towards the Goal</h3>

First, modify your bumper to be better at holding the ball.  For example,
if you built the bumper out of the yellow beams, pictured below:

<p>
Reverse the yellow pieces so that they're curving out, instead of in.
Now, modify the <a href="guidenqc/linebot1.nqc">linebot1.nqc</a>
to follow a black line and stop when it crosses the yellow line marking
the front of the goal.  Your robot should then back up, turn around,
and the follow the black line back to the starting area, where it should
celebrate making a goal by playing a song.

<h3>Penalty Kicks</h3>

For this program, the ball will be placed in the front of the goal and
your robot should again follow the taped line from the starting area.
When the robot contacts the ball (i.e. the bumper is pressed), the robot
should stop, turn around and return to the starting area.  If hit with
enough force, the ball should roll into the goal.  If not, move the 
ball closer to the goal, and try again with the same program.
your robot should again follow the 

<h3>Goalies</h3>

Each robot will take a turn being the goalie.  When the robot is the
goalie, he should:
<ul>
    <li> sing a song to celebrate any balls he catches in his bumper.
    <li> if he catches a ball, move it out of the goal and return
	to the goal.
</ul>
If there's time, the goalie should also send a message to the shooter
that he's caught the ball.  Modify the shooter's program to only
celebrate if the goalie does not catch the ball.  See the book's
chapter on communication (Chapter 17) for more details on sending 
and receiving messages.

<h3>Projects</h3>

If there's time, you should work on designing your project.  Look
at the <a href="projects.html">project page</a> for ideas.  Also,
fill out the <a href="project_planning.html">project planning</a>
with the hardware and software needed for your project.
