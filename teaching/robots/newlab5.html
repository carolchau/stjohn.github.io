<!--
Lab 5:
can do in teams of two if you'd like, since building takes a while...
lab on gearing, ratios, pulleys-- lift something really heavy?
what to use as weights (lego bricks, wheels)?  Can you drag 
your robot box?  How far?
How fast can you make a car go?  
Make a claw/arm (see lego book).  can you make it grasp an object?
can it pick up a lego piece?

<h1>Laboratory Exercise 5</h1>
<h2>Cluster V: Computers and Robots<br>
COSMOS Program, UC Davis<br>
24 July 2001</h2>

<h3>Gears, Arms, and Carrying Things</h3>

Today's lab uses gears and arms to carry objects from
the start to finish zones in the staging area.  Today will
focus mostly on design and construction of the robots.  
There will be time on both Wednesday and Thursday to finish
the construction and design the accompanying programs.

<p><b>Design requirements:</b>  This lab assumes that your
robot can move forward and turn.  Your robot should be able
to tell when it has reached the finish zone, either by using
a touch sensor or light sensor.


<h3>Design Options</h3>

The design of the robot is completely up to you.  In the
end, it must be able to carry and drop objects and move from
the start to finish zones (guided by either the light or
touch sensor).  Some possible designs for this include:
<ul>
    <li> The Minerva robot from Chapter 5 of the <b>Unofficial Guide</b>.
	This is a very efficient robot that has already has a NQC program
	that seeks out black lego pieces, picks them up, and returns to
	where it started.  It is designed to use only two motors (which
	is not necessary due to the extra motors we have), but the arm
	design might be worth copying.
    <li> There are several arms and claws at the end of the 
	<b>Constructopedia</b> book in the Lego kit.  Many of those
	could be used to grasp and transport objects.
    <li> Instead of using an arm that grasps, you could build a robot
	with a front loader basket to scoop under things or a dump 
	truck that can tilt its loading platform to drop objects.	
    <li> Another option is to build an inverted bumper that can push
	objects to their destination.  Adding a touch sensor to the 
	inside bend of the bumper, as well as the attachment to the car,	
	would let you distinguish between bumping an object and bumping
	a wall.
</ul>
 
After you have decided on your design, consult with the TA, to get
any necessary parts.  You can start building your robot now, or work
on the first program for a while, and come back to building the robot
later.


<h3>Start to Finish</h3>

On the patio, there is a staging area (otherwise known as
the children's swimming pool) with many small objects and a
start and finish zone.  The first task for your robot is to move
an object from the start to finish zone.  Upon entering the finish
zone your robot should stop and celebrate (singing and dancing would
be appropriate).

<p>
This program can be done with a robot of standard design with a light
sensor attached.  You might consider modifying one of the earlier
programs that follows a line or flashlight.  Before doing so, measure
the background level of light in the staging area, as well as any
tape lines you may follow or cross.  

<h3>Carrying Objects</h3>

Now, write a program that will carry an object from the start to
finish zone and will drop the object after entering the finish
zone.  Before doing this, you should complete your initial construction
of your object-carrying-apparatus (claw, arm, front-loader, etc).
Depending on the design of your robot, you can also try to deposit
the object in the basket or through the hoop.

<p>
This program should have an extra function called <tt>drop()</tt>
that makes your robot drop the object.  This will get used again
for later programs, so, making this a function will same typing
later.

<h3>What's Next...</h3>

You probably won't have time, but the next step is to return to 
the start zone and pick up another object to take to the finish
zone.  If you build a dump-truck styled carrying device, your 
robot should "ask" for another object by singing when it returns
to the start zone.  It should start it's journey back to the 
finish zone after you signal the object is loaded by clicking 
on a touch sensor.
