Each cluster has a final project that will be part of the
closing event on Saturday, 3 August.  For our cluster, you
have the choice of doing a computational physics project
or building a robot and accompanying programs.

<p>
If you choose to build a robot: 
<ul>
    <li> Your project can have up to 5 programs 
	(the total size of all loaded programs cannot exceed 6K).  
    <li> Different lego configurations for different programs 
	are possible, but you must be able to convert from one 
	to another <b>quickly</b>.   
    <li> Designs need to be submitted during the second week, so,
	we can arrange for special parts (if needed).  
</ul>

Here's some possible ideas:
<ul>
    <li> a jukebox that plays songs on request
    <li> a robot with an arm (see Chapter 5 of the <b>Unofficial Guide</b>)
    <li> a robot that navigates a maze using the light sensor and bumpers
    <li> a team of robots that cooperates in completing a task (like playing
	tag, relay race, moving an object, etc.)
    <li> <a href="http://plymouthschools.com/Science/ScienceCamp/robotics.htm">an 
	aerial tram</a>
    <li> <a href="http://www.enteract.com/~dbaum/lego/creations/garbage.html">a 
	garbage truck</a>
    <li> <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs148/finalexhibition/awkward/index.html">a six-legged robot</a>
    <li> a robot that 
	<a href="http://www.geocities.com/~marioferrari/ttt.html">plays
	tic-tac-toe</a>
    <li> a robot that
	<a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs148/finalexhibition/minesweeper/index.html">plays mindsweeper</a>
    <li> <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs148/finalexhibition/petbot/index.html">a petBot</a>
    <li> <a href="http://unite.com.au/~u11235a/lego/clock/index.html">a 
	clock</a>
    <li> <a href="http://unite.com.au/~u11235a/lego/plotter/">a
	plotter</a>
    <li> <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs148/finalexhibition/parking/index.html">a car that can parallel park</a>
    <li> <a href="http://www.mop.no/~simen/legoscan.htm">a
	scanner</a>
    <li> a robot that <a href="http://community.middlebury.edu/~jlagman/mike_and_jarvis.htm">plays the ukulele</a>
    <br>
    (designed for a <a href="http://community.middlebury.edu/~briggs/Courses/ID002-W02/projects.html">class</a>
    at Middlebury College.  Other designs include
    a pinball machine and an elevator).
