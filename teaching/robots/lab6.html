<h3>Gearing Up and Gearing Down</h3>

<p>
Today's lab focuses on the use of gears to make the robot go faster
or move larger objects than is possible with the motors without using
gears.

<p><b>Design requirements:</b>  This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C.  Further, each 
motor is attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.).  No light or touch sensor is needed.  You will be modifying
the locomotion by adding gears of different sizes.  It will probably
be easiest to use wheels, although legs and treads will also work.

<p><b>Programs used:</b> Today's lab uses
<a href="guidenqc/tankbot1.nqc">tankbot1.nqc</a>.

<p><b>Lab Set-up:</b> The lab assumes that there's several boxes of
increasing weights for the robots to push.  String will also be 
needed for the tug-of-war and tractor pull.


<h3>Speed</h3>

Using the various size gears in the lego box, build a robot that
will go as fast as possible.  How much speed-up is possible with
the standard gears available?  Try out your design, using a 
simple program like
<a href="guidenqc/tankbot1.nqc">tankbot1.nqc</a>.

<h3>Strength</h3>

Now, rebuild your robot to be as strong as possible.  The goal is
to push as much weight as possible.  Outside, there are boxes of
various sizes to test your robot.

<h3>Tractor Pull</h3>

Find another student with batteries about the same strength as
yours.  Attach a piece of string to both robots, and have them
facing away from each other.  Start the robots at the same time
and see whose will pulls the other over the line.

<h3>Tug-of-War</h3>

Attach equal numbers of robots to a piece of string to form
teams for the tug-of-war.  Start all the robots at the same
time (one way to do this is to have a program that starts when
SENSOR_1 has been pushed, and attach (using the long cables)
each robot to the same touch sensor).

<h3>Extra Activities</h3>

If you finish early, you can work on your project.
