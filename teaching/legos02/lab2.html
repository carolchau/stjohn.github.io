<h3>Using Loops</h3>

Today's lab is on using loops in programs and is based on
the <a href="pirouette.nqc">pirouette.nqc</a>,
the <a href="duet.nqc">duet.nqc</a>, and
the <a href="forTurn.nqc">forTurn.nqc</a> from lecture.

<p><b>Design requirements:</b>  This lab assumes that the
two motors are wired to output ports A and C.  Further, each 
motor is attached to a means of locomotion (legs, treads,
feet, etc.).  

<p> A touch sensor and bumper, wired to input port 1, is 
needed if you would like to do the extra activities in the
last section.

<p><b>Lab Set-up:</b> A simple obstable course should be
set up (a slalom course works well) that has even spaced
obstables and at least 6 turns.  The goal is to have the
robots do laps around the course-- precision, not speed,
is what matters.

<h3>Square and Hexagons</h3>

The first part of this lab is to rewrite the program that
traces out a square using a loop.  Copy your turnInPlace
program to a new file called <tt>ngon.nqc</tt>.
Now, modify <tt>ngon.nqc</tt> (using <tt>vi</tt> for Cluster
V and <tt>MacNQC</tt> for Cluster III).  You will 
need to do the following steps (in between each step,
test the program on the robot, to make sure it's doing
the right thing):
<ol>
    <li>  Have the robot turn only 90 degrees or a quarter
	of the way around.
    <li>  Now, have the robot walk straight, followed
	by turning 90 degrees.
    <li>  Put a loop "around" your statements above so
	that it repeats these statements 4 times. 
</ol>

What changes if you want to draw a hexagon instead?  
How about a octagon?


<h3>Ngons</h3>

Modify your program so that <b>only one</b> constant needs
to be changed to change the number of sides your 
robot traces out.  We will use this program as part of
a future lab, so, save it somewhere where you can find it
again.

<h3>Obstacle Course</h3>

There is a simple obstacle course set up outside the lab.
The goal is to have your robot make as many laps
around the course as possible.  For future labs, we will use 
the touch sensors for the obstacle course.  
For this lab, you will need to go solely
by the amount of time that has passed and calculate when to
turn based on time.  

<p>
First, make a program called <tt>lap.nqc</tt> that can make
one lap around the track.  Then, add a loop so that your 
robot will make 5 laps around the track.

<h3>Some Extra Programs</h3>

If you have time, download the following programs:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Singing:</b> Download <a href="sing.nqc">sing.nqc</a>
	to your directory.  Compile the program and download it to
	the robot.  The robot can store up to 5 programs at a time.
	<p>
	<b>For Cluster V:</b> to download <tt>sing.nqc</tt> to the Program 2 
	slot, type:
<pre>
  nqc -pgm 2
  nqc -d sing.nqc 
</pre>
	The first command sets the Program slot to 2.  This can
	also be done by clicking the <b>Pgm</b> button on the 
	robot until you reach Program Slot 2.

	<p>
	<b>For Cluster III:</b> to download <tt>sing.nqc</tt> to the Program
	2 slot, choose "Program Slot" under the "Program" menu and 
	set it to slot 2.  You can also set it to "Use Front Panel"
	and use the grey <b>Pgm</b> button on the robot to choose the
	desired program slot, as described above for Cluster V.

    <li> <b>Bumper:</b> Download 
	<a href="guidenqc/bumpbot1.nqc">bumpbot1.nqc</a>.  
</ul>

You can also think about what you would like to do for your final
project.  Your project can have up to 5 programs (the total size
of all loaded programs cannot exceed 6K).  Different lego
configurations for different programs are possible, but you must
be able to convert from one to another quickly.   The 
<a href="projects.html">projects.html</a> page contains some ideas
for possible projects.
