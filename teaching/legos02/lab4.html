<h3>Basketball and Dumptrucks</h3>

The goal of today's lab is to move a small object or ball from the
starting zone to the target (or basket).  There are many different
approaches to this problem (see below for description and pictures
of some ways to approach this).

<p>
Cluster V students have the choice of playing basketball or soccer.
Since Cluster III students have already played soccer, they should
design a robot that lifts the ball off the ground.

<p><b>Design requirements:</b>  This lab assumes that the two motors
are wired to output ports A and C.  Further, each motor is attached
to a means of locomotion (legs, treads, feet, etc.).  When using
the light sensor, it is wired to sensor port 2.  The touch sensor
is wired to sensor port 1.  The second touch sensor will be wired
to sensor port 3 if needed.  The extra motor (if playing basketball)
should be wired to output port B.  It should be attached to a
basket or lift that can hold a small ball.

<p><b>Programs used:</b> Today's lab uses <a
href="guidenqc/dumptruck.nqc">dumptruck.nqc</a>, as well as 
<a href="guidenqc/linebot1.nqc">linebot1.nqc</a>.

<p><b>Lab set-up:</b> The lab should have a children's swimming
pool with a small basketball hoop about 4 inches off the ground
and a small cardboard box on the floor of the pool (for the dumptruck
to dump its load).  (If a pool is not available, tape the basket
to the wall and be prepared to chase a lot of basketballs!) Both
baskets have a black line of tape marking the path from the start
area to the basket.  Strips of other color tape can be added to
the approach to the basket (these can be used with the light sensor
to tell the robot when to shoot its basketball or drop its load).


<h3>Different Approaches</h3>

The design of the robot is completely up to you.  In the
end, it must be able to carry and drop objects and move from
the start to finish zones (guided by either the light or
touch sensor).  
The
simplest is to use a lever (no motor attached) to drop the ball
in the basket when the robot bumps into a wall:
<p>
<img src = "bball1.jpg" height=200>
<img src = "bball2.jpg" height=200>
<img src = "bball3.jpg" height=200>

<p>
Another approach is to build a lift that will bring the ball up
to the level of the basket:
<p>
<img src = "bball7.jpg" height=200>
<img src = "bball8.jpg" height=200>
<img src = "lift_closeup3.jpg" height=200>

<p>
You can also build a lift, like that described in the dumpbot chapter
of the book.  Here's a variant on that theme:
<p>
<img src = "bball6.jpg" height=200>
<img src = "bball5.jpg" height=200>

<p>
For more ideas, for possible arms and claws, see the      
<b>Constructopedia</b> book in the Lego kit.  Many of those
could be used to grasp and transport objects.

<p>
After you have decided on your design, consult with the TA, to get
any necessary parts.  You can start building your robot now, or work
on the first program for a while, and come back to building the robot
later.

<h3>Start to Finish</h3>

Outside, there is a staging area (most likely the children's swimming 
pool if there is space) with many small objects and a
start and finish zone.  The first task for your robot is to move
an object from the start to finish zone.  Upon entering the finish
zone your robot should stop and celebrate (singing and dancing would
be appropriate).

<p>
This program can be done with a robot of standard design with a light
sensor attached.  You might consider modifying one of the earlier
programs that follows a line or flashlight.  Before doing so, measure
the background level of light in the staging area, as well as any
tape lines you may follow or cross.  

<h3>Carrying Objects</h3>

Now, write a program that will carry an object from the start to
finish zone and will drop the object after entering the finish
zone.  Before doing this, you should complete your initial construction
of your object-carrying-apparatus (claw, arm, front-loader, etc).
Depending on the design of your robot, you can also try to deposit
the object in the basket or through the hoop.

<p>
This program should have an extra function called <tt>drop()</tt>
that makes your robot drop the object.  This will get used again
for later programs, so, making this a function will same typing
later.

<h3>What's Next...</h3>

You probably won't have time, but the next step is to return to 
the start zone and pick up another object to take to the finish
zone.  If you build a dump-truck styled carrying device, your 
robot should "ask" for another object by singing when it returns
to the start zone.  It should start it's journey back to the 
finish zone after you signal the object is loaded by clicking 
on a touch sensor.


<h3>Projects</h3>

If you finish lab early, you should work on your project.  If
you do not have all the parts to build your robot yet, you can
work on the programs and accompanying webpage.
