<hr>
Today, we're checking out the robots, assembling a simple robot,
and testing all the pieces:
<ol>
	<li> Sign out a bin, a robot, 6 AA batteries, 1 9-V battery,
		2 D batteries, and a flashlight.
	<li> Label your bin and robot.
	<li> Assemble the Roverbot.  Directions are on p 10 of 
		<b>Constructopedia</b>.
	<li> Along with the driving base, you should also assemble
		legs, tracks, or wheels, the light sensor, and a
		bumper.
	<li> Try each of the built-in programs from p 12 of the
		<b>User's Guide</b>.  
		<ul>
		    <li> If you built the single bumper: for
			Program 2, use some spare lego pieces to
			attach the second sensor to the robot and
			wire it to the input port.
		    <li> If you built the double bumper: for
			Program 5, attach both touch sensors to
			input port 1 (one on top of the other).
		</ul>
	<li> After testing the built-in programs and sensors, you
		may customize your robot.  The only condition is
		your robot must have 2 motors and means of locomotion
		(treads, feet, wheels, etc.).  The motors should
		be wired to outputs A and C.
	
</ol>

If you don't finish in class today, there's time during the
next lab to work on your robot.
