<h1>Introductory Programming</h1>
	
<p> <!-- From Nancy's stragetic plan -->
Computer Science addresses the fundamental issues of designing 
and implementing computer systems, of efficiently and correctly 
solving computational problems, of investigating new uses of 
computers, and of integrating information systems with organizations 
to improve their functioning.  For all of these, programming is
a fundamental skill.  The computer science program 
offers several different entry points to programming:
</p>

<ul>	
	<li> <b>CMP 230:</b>  A first programming course, taught in Python, 
		and required for computer science, CGI, and mathematics
		major.  The course focuses on programming basics, and also
		uses the Eclipse IDE in the latter half of the course.<br>
		Strongly recommended for the quantitative
		biology minor and students in the sciences.

				<li> <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php">Eclipse Download Page</a>
			</ul>
	<li> <b>CMP 326:</b>  The follow-up course to CMP 230, taught in 
		Java, required for computer science and CGI.  The course
		assumes programming background of CMP 230, but no knowledge
		of Java.  The Eclipse IDE is used as the development enviroment
		througout.<br>
		Strongly recommended for the quantitative
		biology minor.

				<li> <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/fitting/cssequence/CodeConventions.pdf">Java Coding Conventions</a>
			</ul>
	<li> <b>CMP 277:</b>  For students who completed the first 
		programming courses in another language, this self-paced
		course gives a solid introduction to programming in Java.

		for CIS majors.

	<li> <b>LSP 150/350:</b>  Open to members of Macauley Honors College
		and the Lehman Scholars Program, these occasional 
		seminars focus on computers affect on society as well
		as programming (a variant of C for Lego Mindstorm
		Robots).  This course is not being offered in the 2011-2012
		academic year.
