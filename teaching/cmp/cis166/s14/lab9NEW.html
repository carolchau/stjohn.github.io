Today's lab focuses on using pseudocode and designing programs with functions.

<h3>Using Pseudocode</h3>

Give an algorithm in pseudocode-- maybe bubble sort, link to the a sorting demo to show
how it works, and then discuss how to write it out-- maybe not sort, but something that
will have function calls...


<h3>Designing Programs with Functions</h3>

Take a main consisting of function calls and fill them in to make a complete
program...

<p>Python has many built-in functions for working with strings and files 
(<a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">string
methods</a>).  In this lab, we will manipulate files using various string methods.

<p>
Let's start with the program <tt>printfile.py</tt> from the book's website.  Try 
running it.  When it asks for a file, type in printfile.py.  What does it print out?

<p> Next, let's try it on the file <a href="allcaps.txt">allcaps.txt</a>.
Let's change the print line to 
<pre>
	print(data.lower())
</pre>
What happens?  Why?

<p>
To print to a file (instead of to the screen) is very easy:
<ul>
	<li> Open a file for writing
	<li> Add <tt>file=outFileName</tt> to your print statements.
</ul>

<p>Let's do that for the <tt>printfile.py</tt> program:
<pre>
def main():
    fname = input("Enter filename: ")
    infile = open(fname,"r")
    outfile = open("out.txt","w")
    data = infile.read()
    print(data, file=outfile)
</pre>
Run the program.  Where did it send the output?  Modify this program so that all
the output is in <i>lowercase</i> and test it on the text file above.

<p>
In python, there's often many different ways to write the same program.  Let's 
write a program that prints the lines of a file using a for loop:
<pre>
def main():
    print("This program prints a file.")

    # get the input file name
    infileName = input("Please enter name of input file: ")

    # open the files:
    infile = open(infileName, "r")

    # read each line of the input file and print it to outfile
    #   
    for line in infile:
        print(line)

main()
</pre>

What happens when you run this program?  Why is it doublespacing the output?  
When you read a line from a file, it ends with an enter or `newline' character
(often represented as <tt>`\n'</tt>.  We can solve this in several different
ways.  One way to keep the last character of a line
from being printed, we can use the slice operator to truncate the string:
<pre>
	print(line[:-1], file = outfile)
</pre>
The slice, <tt>line[:-1]</tt> says that you would like the string that consists
of all the characters in <tt>line</tt> up to but not including the last character
(since the -1 index always refers to the last character of a string, no matter
how long the string is).

<p>Modify this second program to print out the file all lowercase and
singlespaced, and test it.
