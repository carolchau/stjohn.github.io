<h3>General Notes</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description,
		contain a <tt>main()</tt> function and an invocation of the main at the end of the file:
		For example:
	<pre>
#Name: Herbert H. Lehman
#Date: February 4, 2013
#This program prints: hello world

def main():
	print("Hello world")
	
main()
	</pre>
	<li> About one of every five submitted programs will be chosen, at random, for complete grading.	
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Extra credit will be awarded for the programs that are chosen for complete grading 
	that are submitted early. If a graded 
	program is submitted more than 12 hours early, 1 extra credit point will be awarded. For 
	graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early, 2 extra credit points will be awarded. 
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using Blackboard, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, you must do your own typing.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>

		For example, if your first name is <tt>Eric</tt>, you would use <tt>Euros</tt>.  From
		the table above, we have that one dollar is worth 0.77 euros.
		You should begin the program by printing out your name.
		On each line, your program should write the number of dollars and the corresponding
		number of your currency.  For example:
		<pre>
Eric's converting program
		
Dollars:    Euros:
1           0.77
2           1.53
3           2.3
4           3.07
5           3.84
		</pre>
		Your program should print the information for 1, 2, ..., 10 dollars.  You do 
		not need to worry about formatting (we will talk about that more in Chapter 5), 
		but you do need to calculate all 10 entries.  
		Hint:  modify the program from the <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.
		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 13 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for distance in feet and prints the number of 
		yards and feet (assume that there are 3 feet to the yard).  
		For example, if
		the user entered, 10, your program would output, <tt>3 yards 1 feet</tt>.
		Note that you should use "yards" and "feet" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect). 

		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 14 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for the number of roses they have ordered
		for Valentine's Day, and prints the number of dozens of roses and single roses.
		For example, if
		the user entered, 26, your program would output, <tt>2 dozen and 2 roses</tt>.
		Note that you should use "dozen" and "roses" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).

<hr>

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 18 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for time in days and prints the number of 
		years and days (assume that it is not a leap year and there are 365 days in a year).  
		For example, if
		the user entered, 400, your program would output, <tt>1 years 35 days</tt>.
		Note that you should use "years" and "days" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).  


	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 19 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Built into python is a module for simple drawing, called Turtle graphics 
		(see <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>).  To 
		use the Turtle graphics module, you must import it, just like with the math module.
		Some basic turtle commands are:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>left(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>right(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>forward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
			<li> <tt>backward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
		</ul>
		
		The following draws a 4-sided figure or square:
		<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(4):
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(90)        #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()		
		</pre>
		
		Modify this program to draw a <b>6-sided figure or hexagon</b>.  Make sure to 
		include the standard introductory comments at the beginning of your program
		as well as to <b>change the name of the turtle to your name.</b>


	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 20 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Modify the turtle program to draw two squares to the screen.  
		Make sure to 
		include the standard introductory comments at the beginning of your program
		as well as to <b>change the name of the turtle to your name.</b>
	
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 21 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program to calculate how much money you would have if saved $10 a month 
		in your change jar.  Since you are not using a bank, no interest is paid on 
		your savings.  Your program should ask the user for the number of days and display
		the amount of money for each day.  The starting amount of money is $0.
		Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter the number of days:  4
Month 1:  $10
Month 2:  $20
Month 3:  $30
Month 4:  $40
		</pre>

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 24 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program to calculate how much money you would have if your money doubled
		every day.  Your program should ask the user for the number of days and display
		the amount of money for each day.  The starting amount of money is $1.
		Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter the number of days:  8
Day 1:  $1
Day 2:  $2
Day 3:  $4
Day 4:  $8

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 25 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for an amount and calculates the total after
		applying the New York City tax rate of 8.875 percent.  For example, if the user
		enters 1000, your program should print $1088.75 (do not worry about formatting 
		the number to have only two digits after the decimal-- we will discuss how to do
		that in Chapter 5).

		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 26 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Problem #5, p 76:  The Konditorei coffee shop sells coffee at $10.50 a pound 
		plus the cost of shipping.  Each order ships for $0.86 per pound + $1.50 fixed
		cost overhead.  Write a program that asks the user for the number of pounds of
		coffee and calculate the cost of an order.
		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 27 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that will calculate the cost per ride on an unlimited ride 
		MetroCard.  Your program should ask the user for two numbers:  the cost of 
		the card, and the number of rides.  The program should then print the cost
		per each ride.  For example, if the user paid $30 for the card and took 25 
		trips, your program should print out the cost per ride of $1.20.

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 3 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that will calculate the average miles per hour for a trip.  
		Your program should ask the user for two numbers:  the miles traveled, and 
		the number of hours the trip took.  The program should then print the average
		miles per hour.  For example, if the user traveled 10 miles in 2 hours, your
		program should print out that they averaged 5 miles per hour.

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 4 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for a line of text and prints out the 
		same line with every character in upper case.  For example:

<pre style="color:#999">
Please enter a line:  I love python
I LOVE PYTHON
</pre>

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 5 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for a line of text and prints the number
		of characters entered:

<pre style="color:#999">
Please enter a line:  I love python
You entered 13 characters.

	<li style="color:#999"> 
		<b>Due Date: 7 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that measures strings in terms of the length of your name.  For
		example, if your first name is "Kate", you would use the length of the string 
		"Kate" which is 4.  If your name is "Daniel", you would use the length 6.
		
		<p>Your program should print out <b>your name</b> to the screen and then ask the user
		to enter a string.  You should then print out how long the string is in terms of
		the length of your name (that is, the length of the user's string divided by
		your length).  For example,
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Kate"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 2.25 Kate's long.
		</pre>
	While, if your name was Daniel, your program would look like:
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Daniel"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 1.8333 Daniel's long.
		</pre>

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 10 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Modify the <tt>encode.py</tt> program from <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>
		to use an offset entered by the user to encrypt the message.  The program in the
		lab encrypts each character by the character 1 place ahead in the alphabet.  Your
		program should ask the user for the offset and encrypt their string by replacing
		each character by one that is <i>offset</i> places ahead in the alphabet.	



	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 11 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Problem #9, p 163:  Write a program that prints out the number of words in 
		a sentence entered by the user. <br>
		(Hint:  how can you tell when a word ends?  Count those and adjust slightly
		to get a count on the number of words.)

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 12 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Problem #10, p 163:  Write a program that prints out the average word length in 
		a sentence entered by the user. 

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 14 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for a list of prices of items purchased and 
		prints out each price and the total, formatted nicely. Here is a 
		sample run of the program:
		<pre>
Please enter the prices:  2.34, .99, 100, 81.05, 90
		
Your receipt:
         2.34
         0.99
       100.00
        81.05
        90.00

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 17 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for a name of a file and then prints to 
		the screen the number of characters and lines in the file.
		Hint:  see <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6.</a>

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 19 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file and a line length.
		Your program should then "wrap" all lines that are longer than line length,
		and print the result on the screen.
		For example, if the file contains:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789012345
This line has more than 20 characters.
This one has less 
And this one has lots, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		and the user entered the length of 20, all lines longer than 20 would 
		be wrapped to the next line:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789
012345	
This line has more t
han 20 characters.
This one has less 
And this one has lot
s, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		Hint:  break the problem in to parts:  first write a program that will print lines
		from a file to the screen (see <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6<a>).  Then modify 
		your initial program to only print lines up to the length entered.  And, to finish
		the program, then add in the code that prints lines that are longer than the length 
		entered.
		

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 21 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks for a list of names and a list of cities, as well as
		a file.  Your program should use the file as a template to generate letters 
		customized with the names and cities entered.  You should 
		generate a letter for each name/address pair on the inputted lists.
		The customized letters should replace
		every the <tt>**INSERT NAME HERE**</tt> with the name and <tt>**INSERT ADDRESS HERE**</tt>
		with the address.

		<p>
		For example, if the file <tt>inputTemplate.txt</tt> contained:

		<pre>
						New York, New York
						11 March 2013
	
**INSERT NAME HERE**
**INSERT ADDRESS HERE**

Dear **INSERT NAME HERE**,

	<b>This is the make-up problem for #28.  The score from the problem below can 
	replace your grade for #28.</b>	
	
	<p>For this problem, you will read and graph values from a CSV file.  A CSV file is a "Comma-Separated File," in which the values on each line are separated from each other by commas.  Problem 28 used an example of a CSV file.  This kind of file is used to represent data from all sorts of activities, to be downloaded from the Web.

	<p>Your file will contain labels for the x axis in the first row and labels for the y axis in the first column.  All other values will be numbers, which may or may not be contained in quotes.
     
	<p>Write a function that accepts a line from a CSV file and returns a list of numbers.    The numbers may or may not be contained in single or double quotes.  This function should work for any CSV file in which the first column contains labels and the rest contain only numbers.

	<p>The sample file we are providing represents sectors of the gross domestic product from the first quarter of 2002 to the last quarter of 2012. Each line of the file represents one sector of the economy (Consumption, Investment, Net Exports, Government, and Residual).  The first row of the file contains labels for the time periods (I2002 for first quarter of 2002, II2002 for second quarter of 2002, etc.), the first column contains labels for the sectors.   

	<p>Next, write a main program that uses the function to create several graphs, each 
graph representing a single line of the CSV file.  Numeric values appear in row 2, column 2 through the last row and last column, but they may be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.  

	<p>For example, if you read the file:

<pre>
Time period,  I2002, II2002,III2002, IV2002,  I2003, II2003,III2003, IV2003
GDP,11467.1,11528.1,11586.6,11590.6,11638.9,11737.5,11930.7,12038.6
Consumption,7953.7,7994.1,8048.3,8076.9,8117.7,8198.1,8308.5,8353.7
Investment,1781.9,1803.4,1808,1808.3,1810.4,1821.8,1888.4,1959.9
Exports,-510.2,-534.6,-553.9,-595.2,-584.9,-612.4,-602.8,-614.6
Government,2250.4,2272,2290.4,2305.7,2300.9,2335.1,2342,2343.7
Residual,-27.9,-24,-16.8,-20.1,-18.8,-14.7,-11,-8.1
</pre>

You should display the graph:

You may include labels, but you do not have to.
