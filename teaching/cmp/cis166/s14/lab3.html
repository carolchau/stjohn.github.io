Today's lab will focus on turtle graphics.  
An excellent overview of turtle graphics can be found at the

<h3>Turtles</h3>

Turtle graphics was originally introduced in 1966 as part of the Logo programming language 
and is available as a <a href="python module">http://docs.python.org/3.2/library/turtle.html</a>.
The turtle module allows you to draw graphics to the screen.  

<p>
Let's start with a simple program:
		<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(4):
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(90)        #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()		
		</pre>

The first line:
		<pre>
import turtle
		</pre>
loads the turtle graphics module.  Like the math library, the turtle graphics library is
a standard part of python but needs to be imported to be used in your program.

<p>We next define the <tt>main()</tt> function and set up two turtle graphics objects:
		<pre>
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window
		</pre>

The first line creates a turtle, named daniel.  The next line creates a new window,
where the graphics will appear.

<p>  The <tt>main()</tt> function has a loop that has two commands:
<ul>
	<li> move forward (<tt>daniel.forward(100)</tt>)
	<li> turn 90 degrees to the right (<tt>daniel.right(90)</tt>)
</ul>
The last line in our <tt>main()</tt> program closes the graphics window when the
user clicks the mouse on the window.


<p>What happens when these commands are repeated 4 times?  Try running the program
to see what is drawn.

<p> Let's make two small changes to our program:
<ul>
	<li> have the loop repeat 50 times 
	<li> have the turtle move forward <tt>i</tt> steps (instead of 100)
</ul>

Your program should now look like:
		<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(50):
        daniel.forward(i)       #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(90)        #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()		
		</pre>

<p>Run you program (choose "Run Module" from the "Run" menu, or F5).
What is drawn?  How can you make it fill the entire window?

<p>What happens if we had left the steps forward never changing (but a bit
shorter (10 instead of 100) so it appears on the screen), but instead
changed the right turn from 90 degrees to <tt>i</tt> degrees:
		<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(50):
        daniel.forward(10)      #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(i)         #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()		
		</pre>


</div>
<div>

<p> Some basic turtle commands are:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>left(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>right(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>forward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
			<li> <tt>backward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
			<li> <tt>color(s):</tt> changes the drawing color to <tt>s</tt>
					(e.g. <tt>daniel.color("green")</tt>
		</ul>
