<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Students are expected to learn both the material covered in 
class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading. Completing homework 
is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from 
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's 
<a href="http://www.lehman.edu/academics/advising/academic-integrity.php">Academic Integrity Policy</a>,
(available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). <br>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. 

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will take design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must 
perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style.
Approximately 12 programs will be graded thoroughly and returned with 
comments.  The top 10
grades will be counted for the homework score.
<b>No late homework is accepted.</b>

<p><b>Quizzes:</b> At every class meeting, there will be a quiz based
on the lecture notes, reading, submitted programs, and laboratory 
exercises.  As the semester progresses, at least one question on 
every quiz will be a review question.  The top 25 (out of 29 possible)
quiz scores will count towards the quiz score in the final grade.

<p><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is required.  The times for the
exam are assigned by the Registrar:

	<ul>
		<li>19 May
			<ul>
			<li> 8:30-10:30am for CMP 230-C401 (MW 9-11)

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Textbook:</b> <i>Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science</i> by John Zelle
(ISBN 1887902996).  Approximate price: $40 (available on-line from 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> & <a href="http://www.powells.com">Powells</a>).


<p>
<b>Technology:</b> This course uses the <b>python</b> programming language available from 
<a href="http://www.python.org">python.org</a>.  It
is available on the department computers in Gillet Hall. 


<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
