In Lab 3, we started with a program that drew a square to the screen, using turtle graphics:
<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(4):
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(90)        #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()
</pre>
Recall, our turtle, named <tt>daniel</tt>, moved forward 100 steps, made a 90 degree right
turn, and then repeated these actions for a total of 4 times.  Let's modify it, so, that it 
will draw an 8 sided polygon:
<pre>
import turtle

def main():
	numSides = 8                #Number of sides of the polygon
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(numSides):
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(360/numSides)	#Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()
</pre>
To make it easier to modify, we stored the number of sides in just one place (the variable
named <tt>numSides</tt>) and use it in range statement in the for-loop as well as calculating
the amount needed to turn each time.

<p>Run the program to make sure there's no errors.  On the graphics window, you should see
an octogon (8-sided) figure.  How would you make an octogon like this:
<p>

<p>
Notice that the edges change colors, the first, third, fifth, and seventh edges are red;
while the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth edges are green.  Since we start counting with
0, we have that the edges are red when the loop index variable <tt>i</tt> is 0,2,4,6.  The edges
are green when the loop index variable is 1,3,5,7.  

<p>To make the colors change, we need to test for when the loop index variable is even.  
A way to say that mathematically is <tt>i</tt> is even when <tt>i</tt> divided by 2 has no remainder.
In python, we can write that as:
<pre>
	if i % 2 == 0:
		daniel.color("red")
</pre>

Let's add that to our program:
<pre>
#Blinking turtle for introductory programming lab

import turtle

def main():
    numSides = 8
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(numSides):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            daniel.color("red")      
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(360/numSides)  #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()
</pre>
What does that do?  How do we make the color green for when <tt>i</tt> is odd?  Let's add in an 
<tt>else</tt> to our <tt>if</tt> statement:
<pre>
	if i % 2 == 0:
		Turn daniel red
	else:
		Turn daniel green
</pre>
Putting all the pieces together, we get:
<pre>
#Blinking turtle for introductory programming lab

import turtle

def main():
    numSides = 8
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(numSides):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            daniel.color("red")
        else:
            daniel.color("green")        
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(360/numSides)  #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()
</pre>

Try the program to make sure that the colors change, depending on the value of <tt>i</tt>.
Next, change your program to make a 10-sided polygon (hint:  you only need to change one line).
