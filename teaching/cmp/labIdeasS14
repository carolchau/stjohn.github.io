Ideas for labs:

CIS
X  Lab 10:  even/odd polygons
X  Lab 11:  random walk-- Lab 12 CIS
X  Lab 12:  random walk for stock prices, using booleans in the decisions
Lab 13:  file loops-- 
Lab 14:  basic sorting (nested loops, without graphics) similar to Lab 11 CMP


CMP 
X  Lab 10:  Mystery point game
X  Lab 11:  sorting (nested loops, using Zelle's graphics)
X  Lab 12:  random walk-- Lab 11 CIS
Lab 13:  billiard balls?  make each an object, with color and number displayed (in init)
	have a method called heading and steps, have it bounce off walls
Lab 14:  dictionaries-- hashing tweets?




CMP Lab 9:   Archery Shooting (if statements)
CMP Lab 10:  Mystery Point Game
CMP Lab 11:  Searching files using nested loops/file loops-- bank balance or name data?
CMP Lab 12:  Monte Carlo Simulation-- focus on simulation
CMP Lab 13:  Defining Classes
CMP Lab 14:  Dictionaries

CIS Lab 9:	 more on functions
CIS Lab 10:  archery, using turtles
CIS Lab 11:  random walk, monte carlo-- focus on if statements
CIS Lab 12:  mystery point, using turtles
CIS Lab 13:  Searching files using loops-- name data?
CIS Lab 14:  Sorting
