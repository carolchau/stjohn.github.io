<h3>General Notes</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description,
		contain a <tt>main()</tt> function and an invocation of the main at the end of the file:
		For example:
	<pre>
#Name: Herbert H. Lehman
#Date: February 4, 2013
#This program prints: hello world

def main():
	print("Hello world")
	
main()
	</pre>
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using Blackboard, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, <b>you must do your own typing</b>.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, your grade will be a 0 for the homework component of the grade (15%
	of your overall grade).  For the third incident, you will fail the class.  We report all 
	incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>
</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>


<ol>
<a id="set1"></a>
	<li > <b>Due Date: 5 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapters 1 & 2</b><br>
		Write a program that prints your name to the screen 20 times.
	<li > <b>Due Date: 9 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapters 1 & 2</b><br>
		Choose a (printable) character from the keyboard.
		Write a program that prints an opening statement and then 
		asks the user for a number and prints your character that many times.
		
		<p>For example:
<pre>
The fault is in our stars...
Please enter a number:  2
*
*
</pre>
		<p>Another sample run:
<pre>
The fault is in our stars...
Please enter a number:  5
*
*
*
*
*
</pre>
		<p>Note:  your program should have a statement you like (different from the sample and
		unique to you, so that the cheat-checking program does not flag it as someone's work)
		and print a character you choose (again, different from the character chosen above).
		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 10 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 2</b><br>
		Write a program that implements the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a> ("informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm") below:
<pre>
1.  Ask the user for the size of their apartment in square meters (size)
2.  Convert the size to square feet using the formula:  convertedSize = size * 10.764
3.  Print out the converted size.
</pre>
		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 11 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 2</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for the diameter of a circular table and prints out the circumference.  For example, if the user enters <tt>10</tt>, your program should print out <tt>31.4159265359</tt>.
		<br><i>Hint:  The circumference of a circle is <tt>Pi*d</tt> where <tt>d</tt> is the diameter of the circle. </i>	

	<li > <b>Due Date: 13 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>	
		
		Write a program that will print out a conversion table for dollars and another

		For example, if your first name is <tt>Eric</tt>, you would use <tt>Euros</tt>.  From
		the table above, we have that one dollar is worth 0.77 euros.
		You should begin the program by printing out your name.
		On each line, your program should write the number of dollars and the corresponding
		number of your currency.  For example:
		<pre>
Eric's converting program
		
Dollars:    Euros:
1           0.77
2           1.53
3           2.3
4           3.07
5           3.84
		</pre>
		Your program should print the information for 1, 2, ..., 5 dollars.  You do not need to worry about formatting (we will talk about that more in Chapter 5), but you do need to calculate all 5 entries.  <br>
		<i>Hint:  modify the second program from the <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.</i>


		

<a id="set2"></a>			
<hr>
	<li > <b>Due Date: 18 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that implements the pseudocode below:
<pre>
1.  Ask the user for the number of days until finals.
2.  Print out the weeks until finals (weeks = days // 7)
3.  Print out the leftover days (leftover = days % 7)
</pre>	


	<li > <b>Due Date: 19 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for time in days and prints the number of years and days (assume that there are 365 days in a year).  
		For example, if	the user entered, 1000, your program would output, 
		<tt>2 years 270 days</tt>.
		Note that you should use "years" and "days" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect). 


	<li > <b>Due Date: 20 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for 10 numbers and prints out the total.  
		
		<p>Here is a sample run of the program:
		<pre>
Please enter a number: 5
Please enter a number: 2015
Please enter a number: -100
Please enter a number: 3
Please enter a number: -999
Please enter a number: 8
Please enter a number: 67
Please enter a number: 19
Please enter a number: 17
Please enter a number: -1234

The total is -199		
		</pre>

		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 23 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for 15 letters, accumulates them into a single string variable, and prints the string.
		<p>Here is a sample run of the program:
		<pre>
Please enter a letter: I
Please enter a letter: l
Please enter a letter: o
Please enter a letter: v
Please enter a letter: e
Please enter a letter: P
Please enter a letter: y
Please enter a letter: t
Please enter a letter: h
Please enter a letter: o
Please enter a letter: n
Please enter a letter: !
Please enter a letter: !
Please enter a letter: !
Please enter a letter: !

The string is: IlovePython!!!!		
</pre>
		<br>
		<i>
		Hint:  As for running totals where we initialize the variable to 0, for variables that "accumulate" strings, we initialize the variable to the empty string ("").  Here's a summary of the basic approach for the accummulating design pattern, broken down by the type of the accummulator variable:
<table border="1">
	<tr><td></td><th>Running sums:</th><th>Running products:</th><th>Accumulating Strings:</th><th>Accumulating Lists:</th></tr>
	
	<tr><td>Initialization:</td><td>sum = 0</td><td>prod = 1</td><td>s = ""</td><td rowspan=2>To be explained <br> after Chapter 5... </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Update Action:</td>
		<td>for ...<br>
    		&nbsp;&nbsp;sum = sum + newValue</td>
    	<td>for ...<br>
    		&nbsp;&nbsp; prod = prod * newValue</td><td>for ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;s = s + newValue</td>
    		</tr>	
</table>
		</i>
		<br>


	<li > <b>Due Date: 24 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>


		Modify the book's factorial program to calculate the <i>double factorial</i>.  
		The double factorial is similar to the factorial, except you multiply every other 
		number.  For example, <tt>5!! = 5 * 3 * 1</tt> and <tt>8!! = 8 * 6 * 4 * 2</tt>.
		Formally, <tt>n!! = n*(n-2)*(n-4)*...*(1)</tt>.<br>
		<i>Hint:  you only need to change the <tt>range</tt> statement.</i>	

<a id="set3"></a>
<hr>	
	<li > <b>Due Date: 25 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Think CS Turtle Chapter</b><br>
	
		Implement the following piece of pseudocode as a complete program using turtle graphics:
<pre>
    Repeat 45 times:
        Walk forward 100 steps
        Turn right 92 degrees
</pre>
		Your output should look similar to:
		<br>
		<img src="spiral.jpg">
	
		<br><i>Hint:  See <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>.</i>
		<br>
				<i>Note:  Choose a name for your file that is <b>not</b> <tt>turtle.py</tt>. 
		When executing the "import turtle" statement, the computer first looks in the folder where the file is saved for the turtle module and then in the libraries (and other places on the path).  So, it thinks the module is itself, causing all kinds of errors.  To avoid this, name your program something like "myTurtle.py" or "program8.py".
		</i>

	
	<li > <b>Due Date: 26 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Think CS Turtle Chapter</b><br>
	
	
		Modify the bouncing ball example from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a> so that the ball 
		bounces a little bit <b>more</b> each time.  At the end, each bounce should go off the top of the screen.
		<br>
		<i>Hint:  the only change needed is to the height of the ball.  How can
		you make the height get larger as time increases?</i>



	<li > <b>Due Date: 2 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Think CS Turtle Chapter</b><br>
	
		Using turtle graphics, draw a grid:  
		<br><br>
		<img src="grid.jpg" height=300>

		<p>You may use any combination of turtle commands, but your image should have 9 by 9 grid shown above.
		<br>
		<i>Hint: Resize the drawing canvas to give coordinates that are easier to use (see <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a>). </i>
	

	<li > <b>Due Date: 3 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Think CS Turtle Chapter</b><br>
	
		Use turtle graphics to write your name to the screen, surrounded by a box or polygon.  You may write your name in "cursive" by moving the turtle, or may use the <tt>write()</tt> command to have it printed to the graphics screen.
		<br>
		<i>Hint: See <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> for an example of the <tt>write()</tt> method for turtles.</i>		
				
	<li > <b>Due Date: 5 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Think CS Turtle Chapter</b><br>
	
		Write a program that draws a 4 x 4 grid and places a turtle at a location specified by the user (and writes the number '2').  When the user hits enter, move the turtle to the left side of the screen (but keep the same "height" as it moves and again writes the number '2').  To make things easier, assume that the coordinates range from 0 to 3 for both the x and y values.  
		
		<p>
		For example, if the user enters the following at the Python shell:
		<pre>
Please enter coordinates: 2,1
Please hit the enter key to continue:
		</pre>
		We draw the turtle at 2,1 (for reasons that will become apparent later, we're representing our turtle by the number "2"):
		<br><br>
		<img src="game2048grid.jpg" height=300>		
		<p>After the user hits the enter key, we have:
		<br><br>
		<img src="game2048move1.jpg" height=300>		

		<br>
		<i>Hint: break the problem down into pieces:
		<ol>
			<li> First, draw the grid.
			<li> Then ask the user for the coorinates.  
			<li> Move the turtle to those coordinates.
			<li> Write to the screen.
			<li> Then ask the user to hit the enter key.
			<li> Next, move the turtle to the left.
			<li> Write to the screen.
		</ol>
		See <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> for an example of a multi-part program with turtles.</i>		
		
		<p>
		<i>Challenge (ungraded, just for fun):  Can you make the turtle appear to move from its initial location to the the one on the far left (that is, make the original mark disappear when the user hits enter):</i>
		<br><br>

	<!--This set focuses on simple string manipulation:-->

	<li > <b>Due Date: 9 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
	Write a program that asks the user for a string and then prints it out in all upper case and then all lower case.  
	Here is a sample run of the program: 
	<pre>Please enter a string:  Look behind, look here, look ahead
You entered (shouting):  LOOK BEHIND, LOOK HERE, LOOK AHEAD
But better (whispering): look behind, look here, look ahead
</pre>			

		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 10 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>		

		Modify the <tt>encode.py</tt> program from <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>
		to use an offset entered by the user to encrypt the message.  The program in the lab encrypts each character by shifting 1 place ahead in the alphabet.  Your program should ask the user for the offset and encrypt their string by replacing each character by one that is <i>offset</i> places ahead in the alphabet.	
		<p>
		A sample of Caesar cipher disk (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher</a>) with an offset of 13 (that is, every letter in plain text goes to one 13 letters to its right):<br>
		<img src="../f14/Ciphrdsk.gif"> 	
	
	
	<li > <b>Due Date: 11 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>

		Implement the following piece of pseudocode as a complete program:
		
		<pre>
    1.  Prompt the user to enter a string and call it s.
    2.  Let l be the length of s.
    3.  For i from 0 upto l-1:
    4.     print s[0:i]
    5.  For i from 0 upto l-1:
    6.     print s[i:l]
    5.  Print a closing statement

		Need to have some accumulating lists...-->
		
	<li > <b>Due Date: 24 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for the name of file of addresses and a name of an output file.  Your program should replace all occurrences of "NY" with "New York", all occurrences of "NJ" with "New Jersey", and all occurrences of "CT" with "Connecticut" and write the results to the output file.
		For example, if the input file contains:
		<pre>
from wikipedia:
NY-NJ-CT Tri-State Area
The NY metropolitan area includes the most populous city in the United States
(NY City); counties comprising Long Island and the Mid- and Lower Hudson Valley
in the state of New York; the five largest cities in NJ and their vicinities;

		The program <a href="../f14/turtleString.py">turtleString.py</a> takes a string as input and uses that string to control what the turtle draws on the screen (inspired by <a href="http://learn.code.org/s/1/level/23">code.org's graph paper programming</a>).  Currently, the program processes the following commands:
		<ul>
			<li> 'F':  moves the turtle forward
			<li> 'L':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the left
			<li> 'R':  turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right
			<li> '^':  lifts the pen
			<li> 'v':  lowers the pen
		</ul>
		For example, if the user enters the string "FLFLFLFL^FFFvFLFLFLFL", the turtle would move forward and then turn left.  It repeats this 4 times, drawing a square.  Next, it lifts the pen and move forward 3, puts the pen back down and draw another square.
		
		<p>
		Modify this program to allow the user also to specify with the following symbols:
		<ul>
			<li> 'B':  moves the turtle backwards
			<li> 'r':  change the pen color to red			
			<li> 'g':  change the pen color to green
			<li> 'b':  change the pen color to blue
