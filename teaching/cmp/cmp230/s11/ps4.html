<p>
This assignment focuses on objects and graphics from Chapter 5.  The graphics
package is available from the <a="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/">author's page</a> or on Blackboard.

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
<!--
	<li> Write a program that will display an image of your choice.  When
		the user clicks on the image, you should display the red channel
		of the image only.  When the user clicks on the image a second
		time, the image displays in black and white.  Note that a simple
		way to display an image in black and white is to display the
		average in each channel.  That is, for every pixel with RGB values,
		<tt>(r, g, b)</tt>, displaying <tt>( (r+g+b)/3, (r+g+b)/3, (r+g+b)/3 )</tt> 
		will give a black and white version of the image.
	<li> Write a program that show a ball moving across the screen.  The
		user should click on the screen for the starting point, and the 
		ball should move from left to right across the screen for 1000
		iterations of a loop.  Note to slow down the movement so that it
		can be seen, include in your loop, the command <tt>time.sleep(0.1)</tt>
		(also include the statement <tt>import time</tt> at the top of your program).
-->	
	<li> Chapter 4, #2. 
	<li> Chapter 4, #8. 
	<li> Chapter 4, #9-- note that the answer should be displayed in 
		the middle of the rectangle.
	<li> Chapter 4, #11.
	<li> Using the graphics package, write a program that will graph the function n^2
		from 1 to 10 by connecting line segments at integer points.  That is, calculate
		what n^2 is at 1 and at 2, and then draw a line segment between them.  Repeat
		for 2 and 3, and 3 and 4, until you reach n=10.
