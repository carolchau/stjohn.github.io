<p>
This assignment focuses on the material in the first two chapters.
</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Chapter 1, #7: Modify the chaos program (available from the author's website) so that it accepts two inputs and then prints a table with two columns similar to the one shown in Section 1.8.  (Note: You will probably not be able to get the columns to line up as nicely as those in the example.  Chapter 5 discusses how to print numbers with a fixed number of decimal places.)
	<li>Chapter 2, #4: Modify the convert.py program (Section 2.2, and available from the author's website) so that it computes and prints a table of Celsius temperatures and the Fahrenheit equivalences every 10 degrees from 0C to 100C.
	<li>Chapter 2, #6: Suppose you have an investment plan where you invest a certain fixed amount every year.  Modify futval.py (available from the author's web page) to compute the total accumulation of your investment.  The inputs to the program will be the amount to invest each year, the interest rate, and the number of years for the investment.

	<li>Chapter 2, #7: As an alternative to APR, the interest rate accrued on an account is often described in terms of a nominal rate and the number of compounding periods.  For example, if the interest rate is 3% and the interest is compounded quarterly, the account actually earns 3/4% interest every 3 months.
<p>
Modify the futval.py program (available from the author's web site) to use this method of entering the interest rate.  The program should prompt the user for the yearly rate (rate) and the number of times that the interest is compounded each year (periods).  To compute the value in ten years, the program will loop 10*periods times and accrue rate/periods interest on each interation.


	<li>Chapter 2, #9: Write a program that converts distances measured in kilometers to miles.  One kilometer is approximately 0.62 miles.
