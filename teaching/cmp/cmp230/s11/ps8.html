<h2>Problem Set 8<br>
CMP 230: Programming Methods I <br>
Lehman College, City University of New York<br>
Spring 2011<br><br>
</h2>

<div>

<p><span class="announcement">Due Date:  midnight, Friday,  29 April.</span></p>
<p>
This assignment focuses on decisions (Chapter 7).
</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Chapter 7, #2
	<li> Chapter 7, #6
	<li> Chapter 7, #8
	<li> Chapter 7, #16 
	<li> Write a program to animate <b>two</b> circles bouncing around a window.
	The basic idea is to start the two circles somewhere in the interior of the window.
	Use the variables <tt>dx1</tt> and <tt>dy1</tt> (for the first circle) and 
	<tt>dx2</tt> and <tt>dy2</tt> (for the second circle) to control the movements
	of the circles (the <tt>dx/dy</tt> variables should be initialized to 1).  Use
	a large counted loop (say 10000 iterations), and each time through the loop 
	move the circles using <tt>dx1</tt>, <tt>dx2</tt>, <tt>dy1</tt>, and <tt>dy2</tt>.
	When the x-value of the center of the first circle gets too high (it hits an edge), change
	<tt>dx1</tt> to -1.  When it gets too low, change it to 1.  Use a similar approach
	for <tt>dy1</tt> and also for the second circle.  If the two circles get too close
	to each other (i.e. they "collide"), each circle should change directions and 
	continue moving.
	<br>(Note that this is a variant of a previously assigned problem: Chapter 7, #17.)
</ol>
