		nor square roots.  For two points <tt>(x1,y1)</tt> and <tt>(x2,y2)</tt>, 
		the distance is:
		<pre>
		md = |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|
		</pre>
		
	<li> Write a program that when given an amount of change to be made, 
		makes change in that amount using $100 bills, $20 bills, $10 bills,
		$5 bills, $1 bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies using the
		smallest number of bills and coins possible.
