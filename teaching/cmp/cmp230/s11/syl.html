<p>  <b>Description:</b>  <i>4 hours, 4 credits</i>
  Introduction to structured computer programming using 
  a modern high-level programming language. Programming constructs covered to 
  include console I/O, data types, variables, control structures, including 
  iteration, arrays, function definitions and calls, parameter passing, 
  functional decomposition, and an introduction to objects. Debugging techniques. <br>
  <i>Prerequisites:</i> MAT 104 or placement by the Department of Mathematics and 
  Computer Science. <br>
  <i>Note:</i> For students who intend to major in Computer Science, Mathematics, 
  Computer Graphics and Imaging, or the sciences. Some previous computer programming 
  experience is highly recommended.

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Students are expected to learn both the material covered in 
class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading. Completing homework 
is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from 
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's <a href="http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/provost/enrollmentmgmt/collegenow/plagiarism/resources/Lehman_Policy.pdf">academic integrity code</a> (available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). <br>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. 

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will take design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must 
perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style.
Of the five programs submitted
via Blackboard, two will be graded thoroughly and returned with comments.  The homework
grade will only be based on the two programs chosen each week.  No late homework is accepted.

<p><b>Exams:</b> There will be two midterm exams and a final exam.  The dates of
the exams are:
<ul>
<li>First Midterm: 8/9 March
<li>Second Midterm: 5/6 April
<li>Final Exam:
	<ul>
		<li> Section I401 (M W 9-11): 23 May, 8:30-10:30am
		<li> Section ZG81 (T Th 6-8): 24 May, 6:15-8:15pm
		<li> Section  B401 (T Th 9-11): 26 May, 8:30-10:30am
		<li> Section C401 (T Th 11-1): 26 May, 11am-1pm
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Problem Sets: 40% </li>
      <li>Exams: 60%       </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Textbook:</b> <i>Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science</i> by John Zelle
(ISBN 1887902996).  Approximate price: $40 (available on-line from 
<a href="www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> & <a href="www.powells.com">Powells</a>).


<p>
<b>Technology:</b> This course uses the <b>python</b> programming language.  It
is available on the department computers in Gillet Hall. 
See the <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/fitting/forclasses/cmp230Spring2011/obtainingPython.html">installation instructions</a> for information on installing
it on your own machine.

<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.

<p>
<b>Tutoring:</b> Departmental tutoring is available in the Math Lab on the 2nd floor of Gillet Hall.

<p><b>Accommodating Disabilities:</b>  Lehman College is committed to providing access 
to all programs and curricula to all students.Ê Students with disabilities who may need 
classroom accommodations are encouraged to register with the Office of Student Disability 
Services.Ê For more info, please contact the Office of Student Disability Services,
