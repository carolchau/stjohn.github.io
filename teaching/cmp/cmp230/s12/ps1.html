<p><span class="announcement">Due Date:  midnight, Friday, 3 February.</span></p>

<p>
We will be using Blackboard throughout the semester to submit
assignments, so, the primary goal of the first assignment is to 
become accustomed to using the system.

<h3>Using Blackboard</h3>

<p>This course will use the on-line Blackboard system for submitting 
work electronically and on-line quizzes. Blackboard should be accessible 
through your CUNY portal account (<a href="http://portal.cuny.edu">http://portal.cuny.edu</a>). 
If you have not used Blackboard in the past, information is available at the Computer Center. 
They can set up your account and have information sheets about using the system.
<!--In addition:
	<blockquote>
	(From Information Technology Center mass email, 1/28/11:)
	<p>
  	During the first week of the semester, Monday (1/31) through Friday (2/4), 
  	we will again provide Walk-In Blackboard Assistance, from 10:00-noon and 2:00-4:00 
  	in Carman Hall B-38.  We will staff this room with our Blackboard team, and 
  	students with login or other Blackboard difficulties can come by for help.
<br>
	After hearing from many of you that students need more assistance with 
	learning Blackboard, the Office of Undergraduate Studies and Online Education 
	has created a Student Blackboard Orientation which students (and faculty) can 
	access by clicking on a new ONLINE INFO tab on the top header of Blackboard.
<br>
	This Blackboard Orientation contains useful information and helpful hints to 
	introduce students to Blackboard's features, and it contains tutorials (like 
	how to post in the discussion board right inside the orientation's discussion 
	board!) along with links to useful sites, tech support information and necessary 
	software.

  	</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Timing Out:</b> If the system times out and locks your attempt (happens rarely 
when the browser or PC crashes), send email to an instructor so they
can clear the attempt so you can try again.
