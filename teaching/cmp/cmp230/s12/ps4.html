</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Write a program that will draws some sort of a tree in a graphics window.  
		Your tree should have a trunk, leaves and fruit, and use 3 different colors. 
	<li> Chapter 4, #6 (future value program with graphical entry).
	<li> Write a program that show a ball moving across the screen.  The
		user should click on the screen for the starting point, and the 
		ball should move from left to right across the screen for 1000
		iterations of a loop.<br>
		Notes: 
		<ul>
			<li> To slow down the movement so that it can be seen, include in 
			your loop, the command <tt>time.sleep(0.1)</tt>
			(also include the statement <tt>import time</tt> at the top of your program).
			<li> If the user chooses a point close to the rightmost edge of the
			window, the ball will move out of view.  
		</ul>
	<li> Chapter 4, #9 (rectangle). Note that the rectangle should be drawn in the graphics
		window, while the area and perimeter should be printed on the 
		python shell window.
	<li> Using the graphics package, write a program that will graph the function n**2
		from 1 to 10 by connecting line segments at integer points.  That is, calculate
		what n**2 is at 1 and at 2, and then draw a line segment between them.  Repeat
		for 2 and 3, and 3 and 4, until you reach n=10.
</ol>
