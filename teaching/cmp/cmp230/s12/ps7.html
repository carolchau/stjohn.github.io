<p>
This assignment focuses on decisions (Chapter 7).

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Write a function that returns the number of positive integers in a list of integers.
		Include your function in a program that allows the user to enter a list of numbers which 
		is then used to demonstrate your function.
	<li> Write a program that reads in a text file as indicated by the user, determines the 
		longest word in the file, and prints that word out to the screen. Assume the file has 
		one word per line. In the event that more than one word qualifies as the longest, 
		print out the first such word only.
	<li> Write a program asks the user for their birthdate (MM/DD/YYYY format) and 
		prints out if the user is older than 18 and also if the user is over 21 as
		of April 20th, 2012.
	<li> Fixing the line:  Many systems decide who goes first based on priority.
		For example, the registration process at Lehman gives priority for students with 
		more credits.  Similarly, printer queues (lines) let a printing job with 
		higher priority go first.  Write a function that takes a list of priorities (a list
		of numbers).  The function should then compare the zero-th entry to the first
		entry, and interchange them if the first is bigger than the second.  The function 
		should continue comparing subsequent entries until it gets to the end of the list.  
		
		<p>For example, a call to the function, <tt>fixLine([9,2,15,7,1])</tt> will
		first compare <tt>l[0] = 9</tt> to <tt>l[1] = 2</tt>.  Since <tt>2</tt> is less 
		than <tt>9</tt>, your function should interchange the two entries, resulting in 
		the list:
		<pre>
		[2,9,15,7,1]
		</pre>
		Next, your function should compare <tt>l[1] = 9</tt> to <tt>l[2] = 15</tt>.  <tt>15</tt>
		is bigger than <tt>9</tt>, so, there is no need to interchange them, and the list
		stays the same:
		<pre>
		[2,9,15,7,1]
		</pre>
		Continuing, the function compares <tt>l[2] = 15</tt> to <tt>l[3] = 7</tt> and 
		interchanges them:
		<pre>
		[2,9,7,15,1]
		</pre>
		The process repeats with <tt>l[3] = 15</tt> and <tt>l[4] = 1</tt>, resulting in:
		<pre>
		[2,9,7,1,15]
		</pre>		
	
		<p> Note that your function will only fix the largest entry's position in line
		(if you run it repeatedly, it will put the rest of the entries in order).
		
		<p> Write a main function that will ask the user to enter a list of numbers
		(separated by commas) and then pass that list to your function.  The main 
		function should then print out the list resulting from your function.
