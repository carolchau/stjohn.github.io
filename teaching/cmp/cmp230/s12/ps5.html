</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>

<!--
	<li> Write a program that prompts the user to enter 5 numbers and 
		then writes the minimum and maximum values entered to the screen.
	<li> Chapter 7, #5
	<li> Chapter 7, #7
	<li> Chapter 7, #11 
	<li> Chapter 7, #17 

	<li> Chapter 5, #4 (acronym):  Note that the phrase could be of
		any length.
	<li> Chapter 5, #7 (Caesar cipher)
	<li> Chapter 5, #9 (number of words in a sentence)
	<li> Chapter 5, #10 (average word length in a sentence)
	<li> Chapter 5, #16 (quiz score histogram)
-->
	<li> Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and
		then writes the minimum and maximum values to the screen.  Note that 
		the list of numbers can be of any length and should be separated by commas.
	<li> Chapter 5, #4 (acronym):  Note that the phrase could be of
		any length.
	<li> Write a program that prompts the user for the name of an input file. 
		Your program should then write to the screen the number of characters in the file.
 
	<li> Write that asks the user for a file name.  You may assume that the file has
		the following format:
		<pre>
		12.3 10
		99 84.3
		0.3 20
		</pre>
		(two numbers per line).  Your program should use a graphics window to display the 
		information in the file.  In particular, your program should read each line from the file 
		and display a circle at the coordinates indicated.  If the first line is <tt>12.3 10</tt>
		should draw a small circle at <tt>(12.3, 10)</tt> on the graphics window.
		
		<p>
		You may assume that all points have coordinates between 0 and 100 and set the 
		coordinates of the window to be bounded by 0 and 100 in both directions.
	<li> The Social Security Administration maintains 
	<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html">lists</a> of baby names 
		indexed by state and year.  Write a program that asks the name of a file
		and a year, prints how many years that name occurred.
		
		<p>Each of these files have the same format:  on each line
		there is two characters for the state, followed by 'M' or 'F' for
		gender, the year, the name, and then the number of babies given that
		name that year.  For example, 
		
		<pre>
 NYM1910Herbert,83
 NYM1910Leo,80
 NYM1910Andrew,79
 NYM1910Ernest,79
 NYM1910Milton,79
		</pre>
		is part of the file <a href="../f11/NY.TXT">NY.TXT</a> containing the data
		for New York State.  Note that in 1910, there were 83 boys named Herbert,
		80 boys named Leo, and 79 boys eached named Andrew, Ernest, and Milton.
		
		<p>If the user types in a name that has longer versions in the file, your program
		should print out all the matches.  For example, if the user wants to search for
		<tt>Chris</tt> and the file contains longer versions of the name (i.e. <tt>Christina</tt>,
		<tt>Christopher</tt>, and <tt>Christine</tt>), your program should count all of these.
		Note that this simplifies the problem since this is the default action of the string
		method <tt>count()</tt>.
</ol>
