<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Chapter 8, #3 (doubling investment)
	<li> Chapter 8, #9 (fuel efficiency)
	<li> Write a program that prompts the user for the names of an input file and an output file. 
	Assume the input file consists of words separated by spaces. The program creates an output 
	file containing the same words, but with all occurrences of your first name replaced by your initials.
	<li> Write a function that takes as input a list of numbers and prints out the numbers on the 
	list until it encounters a negative number.
		Write an accompanying program that demonstrates how your function works.
	<li> Write a program that reads in a text file, infile.txt, and writes out the negative numbers to another
file, outfile.txt. You may assume that every line of the input file consists of exactly one number.

</ol>
