<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Write a program that takes a length in inches and returns the number of 
		feet and inches (recall that there are 12 inches to a foot).  For example, if
		the user entered, 30, your program would output, <tt>2 feet 4 inches</tt>.
		Note that you should use "feet" and "inches" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).  
	<li> Chapter 3, #5 (coffee shop).  Note that the input, the number of pounds of 
		coffee ordered, is
		a decimal number.

	<li> Chapter 3, #13 (sums) 
</ol>
