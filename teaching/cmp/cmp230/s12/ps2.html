<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Modify the chaos program (available from the author's website) so that 
		it prints out 15 values instead of 10.
	<li> Modify the <tt>avg2.py</tt> program (Section 2.5.3 from the
		book) to find the average of four exam scores.
	<li> Modify the convert.py program (Section 2.2, and available from the author's 
		website) so that it computes and prints a table of Celsius temperatures and the Fahrenheit 
		equivalences every 10 degrees from -50C to 50C.
	<li>Chapter 2, #6: Suppose you have an investment plan where you invest a certain fixed amount 
		every year.  Modify futval.py (available from the author's web page) to compute the <b>total 
		accumulation</b> of your investment.  The inputs to the program will be the amount to invest 
		each year, the interest rate, and the number of years for the investment.
	<li> Write a program that converts distances measured in miles to kilometers.  
		One mile is approximately 1.61 kilometers.

</ol>
