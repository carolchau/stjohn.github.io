</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Chapter 9, #1 (raquetball)
	<li> Write a guessing game program.  Use the random number generator to 
	choose an integer between 0 and 100.  Ask the user to guess your number. 
	If the user guesses too low, tell them so and repeat. 
	If the user guesses too high, tell them so and repeat. 
	If the user guesses correctly, congratulate them and end the program. 
	<li> Chapter 9, #11
	<br>(Hint:  Ask the user for <i>n</i> the number of rolls in the 
	simulation and count how many of those rolls have all 5 die with matching
	values.)
	<li> Chapter 9, #13 (random walk)
	<br><!--(Hint:  you should write a graphics program that takes <i>n</i>, the number
	of steps as the input), and starts with an object
	in the middle of the graphics window, and at each iteration, 
	randomly chooses to moves up, down, left or right.)-->
<!--	<li> <b>One more program, or only 4 for this last assignment?</b>-->
