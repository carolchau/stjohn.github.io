<p>
This assignment focuses on loops and booleans (Chapter 8).
</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Chapter 8, #8  (gcd)
	<li> Chapter 8, #11 (heating and cooling days)
	<li> Chapter 8, #14 (convert image from color to gray scale)
	<li> Chapter 8, #15 (convert image to its negative)
	<li> Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer 
	(for example, 12345678).  The program sums the digits of the integer 
	(in this example it gets 36).  It then sums the digits of that integer 
	(in the example, it gets 9).  It keeps going until it is down to a 
	one-digit number, which it prints.
<!--	
	<li> Write a program for the game 'Hangman.'  Your program
	should prompt the user for the name of a text 
	file containing the secret word on the first line. The program should tell the user the length 
	of the first word.  Then, prompt the user to guess a 
	letter.  If they get it right, the letter should be filled in  
	the word, if they get it wrong, add to mistake count.  The
	program should continue to prompt the user and fill in letters
	until the user has all the letters in the word, or the mistake
	count reaches 10.
	
	<p>
	For example, 
<pre>
Please enter file name:  words.txt
The secret word has 6 unknown letters:  _ _ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter:  K
There is no K, mistake count = 1
The secret word has 6 unknown letters:  _ _ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter: A
There is no A, mistake count = 2
The secret word has 6 unknown letters:  _ _ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter: T
There is a T, mistake count = 2
The secret word has 5 unknown letters:  _ _ T _ _ _
Guess a letter: H
There is a H, mistake count = 2
The secret word has 4 unknown letters:  _ _ T H _ _
Guess a letter: E
There is no R, mistake count = 3
The secret word has 4 unknown letters:  _ _ T H _ _
Guess a letter: R
There is no R, mistake count = 4
The secret word has 4 unknown letters:  _ _ T H _ _
Guess a letter: I
There is no 1, mistake count = 5
The secret word has 4 unknown letters:  _ _ T H _ _
Guess a letter: N
There is no R, mistake count = 6
The secret word has 3 unknown letters:  _ _ T H _ N
Guess a letter: P
There is a P, mistake count = 6
The secret word has 2 unknown letters:  P _ T H _ N
Guess a letter: Y
There is a Y, mistake count = 6
The secret word has 1 unknown letters:  P Y T H _ N
Guess a letter: O
There is a O, mistake count = 6
The secret word has 5 unknown letters:  P Y T H O N

Congratulations!  You won the game!
