<p><span class="announcement">Due Date:  noon, Friday, 16 September.</span></p>

<p>
This assignment focuses on computing with numbers from Chapter 3.
</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Write a program that takes the length of a class in minutes
		and returns the number of hours and minutes.  For example, if
		the user entered, 160, your program would output, <tt>2 hours 40 minutes</tt>.
		Note that you should use "hours" and "minutes" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).  
	<li> Chapter 3, #2 (pizza).  Note that the input, the price of pizza, is
		a decimal number.
	<li> A function related to factorial is the double factorial, n!! = n(n-2)(n-4)...1
		for odd numbers and n!! = n(n-2)(n-4)...2 for even numbers.  
		For example, 
		7!! = 7*5*3*1 = 105.  Modify the <tt>factorial.py</tt> (from
		the textbook or author's website) to calculate the double factorial.
	<li> Chapter 3, #14 (average)
	<li> Chapter 3, #15 (approximating pi) 
</ol>
