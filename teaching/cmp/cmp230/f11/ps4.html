<p><span class="announcement">Due Date:  noon, Friday, 23 September.</span></p>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Chapter 4, #3.  Write a program that will draws some sort of face.  
		Your face should have the outline of the face, a mouth, a nose, and 
		two eyes, and use 3 different colors. 
	<li> <span class="announcement">This problem was harder than we thought, 
		and has been dropped from the assignment.  You do not need to turn 
		this one in.</span>
		Write a program that will display an image of your choice.  When
		the user clicks on the image, you should display the blue channel
		of the image only.  When the user clicks on the image a second
		time, the image displays in black and white.  Note that a simple
		way to display an image in black and white is to display the
		average in each channel.  That is, for every pixel with RGB values,
		<tt>(r, g, b)</tt>, displaying <tt>( (r+g+b)/3, (r+g+b)/3, (r+g+b)/3 )</tt> 
		will give a black and white version of the image.<br>
		Note:  you need to use a GIF or PPM file for your image.  Here
		are some that you can use:  <br>
		<p align=center>
		 <a href="logo.gif" ><img src="logo.gif" height=100></a>
		<a href="lehman.gif"><img src="lehman.gif" height=100></a>
		<a href="quad.gif"><img src="quad.gif" height=100></a>
		</p>
	<li> Write a program that show a ball moving across the screen.  The
		user should click on the screen for the starting point, and the 
		ball should move from left to right across the screen for 1000
		iterations of a loop.<br>
		Notes: 
		<ul>
			<li> To slow down the movement so that it can be seen, include in 
			your loop, the command <tt>time.sleep(0.1)</tt>
			(also include the statement <tt>import time</tt> at the top of your program).
			<li> If the user chooses a point close to the rightmost edge of the
			window, the ball will move out of view.  
		</ul>
	<li> Chapter 4, #9-- note that the answer should be displayed in 
		the middle of the rectangle.
	<li> Using the graphics package, write a program that will graph the function log n
		from 1 to 10 by connecting line segments at integer points.  That is, calculate
		what log n is at 1 and at 2, and then draw a line segment between them.  Repeat
		for 2 and 3, and 3 and 4, until you reach n=10.
</ol>
