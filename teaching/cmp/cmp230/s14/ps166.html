<h3>General Notes</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description,
		contain a <tt>main()</tt> function and an invocation of the main at the end of the file:
		For example:
	<pre>
#Name: Herbert H. Lehman
#Date: February 4, 2013
#This program prints: hello world

def main():
	print("Hello world")
	
main()
	</pre>
	<li> About one of every five submitted programs will be chosen, at random, for complete grading.	
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Extra credit will be awarded for the programs that are chosen for complete grading 
	that are submitted early. If a graded 
	program is submitted more than 12 hours early, 1 extra credit point will be awarded. For 
	graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early, 2 extra credit points will be awarded. 
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using Blackboard, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, you must do your own typing.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>

		For example, if your first name is <tt>Eric</tt>, you would use <tt>Euros</tt>.  From
		the table above, we have that one dollar is worth 0.77 euros.
		You should begin the program by printing out your name.
		On each line, your program should write the number of dollars and the corresponding
		number of your currency.  For example:
		<pre>
Eric's converting program
		
Dollars:    Euros:
1           0.77
2           1.53
3           2.3
4           3.07
5           3.84
		</pre>
		Your program should print the information for 1, 2, ..., 10 dollars.  You do 
		not need to worry about formatting (we will talk about that more in Chapter 5), 
		but you do need to calculate all 10 entries.  
		Hint:  modify the program from the <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.
		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 13 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for distance in yards and prints the number of 
		yards and feet (assume that there are 3 feet to the yard).  
		For example, if
		the user entered, 10, your program would output, <tt>3 yards 1 feet</tt>.
		Note that you should use "yards" and "feet" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect). 

		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 14 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for the number of roses they have ordered
		for Valentine's Day, and prints the number of dozens of roses and single roses.
		For example, if
		the user entered, 26, your program would output, <tt>2 dozen and 2 roses</tt>.
		Note that you should use "dozen" and "roses" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).  
		
<hr>

	<li> <b>Due Date: 18 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that asks the user for time in days and prints the number of 
		years and days (assume that it is not a leap year and there are 365 days in a year).  
		For example, if
		the user entered, 400, your program would output, <tt>1 years 35 days</tt>.
		Note that you should use "years" and "days" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).  


	<li> <b>Due Date: 19 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Built into python is a module for simple drawing, called Turtle graphics.  To 
		use the Turtle graphics module, you must import it, just like with the math module.
		Some basic turtle commands are:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>left(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>right(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>forward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
			<li> <tt>backward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
		</ul>
		
		The following draws a 4-sided figure or square:
		<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(4):
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(90)        #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()		
		</pre>
		
		Modify this program to draw a <b>6-sided figure or hexagon</b>.  Make sure to 
		include the standard introductory comments at the beginning of your program
		as well as to <b>change the name of the turtle to your name.</b>


	<li> <b>Due Date: 20 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Modify the turtle program to draw two squares to the screen.  
		Make sure to 
		include the standard introductory comments at the beginning of your program
		as well as to <b>change the name of the turtle to your name.</b>
	
	<li> <b>Due Date: 21 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program to calculate how much money you would have if saved $10 a month 
		in your change jar.  Since you are not using a bank, no interest is paid on 
		your savings.  Your program should ask the user for the number of days and display
		the amount of money for each day.  The starting amount of money is $0.
		Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter the number of days:  4
Day 1:  $10
Day 2:  $20
Day 3:  $30
Day 4:  $40
		</pre>	
		
<hr>
	<li> <b>Due Date: 24 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program to calculate how much money you would have if your money doubled
		every day.  Your program should ask the user for the number of days and display
		the amount of money for each day.  The starting amount of money is $1.
		Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter the number of days:  8
Day 1:  $1
Day 2:  $2
Day 3:  $4
Day 4:  $8
Day 5:  $16
Day 6:  $32
Day 7:  $64
Day 8:  $128
		</pre>	
<!--	
	<li> <b>Due Date: 25 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program to the interest owed on your credit card.  Your program should ask
		the user for the average daily balance and use the following formula to calculate
		the amount owed:
		<pre>
			amount = averageDailyBalance(1.0005)
		</pre>
		<pre>
Please enter the number of days:  8
Day 1:  $1
Day 2:  $2
Day 3:  $4
Day 4:  $8
Day 5:  $16
Day 6:  $32
Day 7:  $64
Day 8:  $128

	<li> <b>Due Date: 19 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Using Zelle's graphics module, 	draw a snowman with your initial (the first letter of
		your first name) on him.  Your display should contain 3 or more circles forming the
		body of the snowman, as well as a mouth and eyes.  In the center of the snowman, you
		should include your initial or name.  You must use at least 3 different colors in your
		drawing.
		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 20 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Modify the bouncing ball example from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a> so that the ball 
		bounces a little bit less each time.  At the end, it should appear to roll across the
		x-axis.  	(Hint:  the only change needed is to the height of the ball.  How can
		you make the height get smaller as time increases?)	
			
	<li> <b>Due Date: 21 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Write a program that displays a graphics window that shows the shades of one of
		the basic colors:  red, green, or blue.  Every color is represented on screen 
		by the amount of red, green, or blue it has (called the "rgb" value):<br><br>
		
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td></td><td><img width=175 src="shadeRed.jpg"></td>
					<td><img width=175 src="shadeGreen.jpg"></td>
					<td><img width=175 src="shadeBlue.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>starting value:</th><td>color_rgb(5,0,0)</td><td>color_rgb(0,51,0)</td><td>color_rgb(0,0,59)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>ending value:</th><td>color_rgb(255,0,0)</td><td>color_rgb(0,255,0)</td><td>color_rgb(0,0,255)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>shape:</th><td>a circle whose x-coordinate and radius increase each step</td>
							<td>a circle whose x and y coordinates increase each step</td>
							<td>skinny, full height rectangles whose x coordinate increases each step</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
		Choose your favorite color of red, green, and blue.  Let <tt>startingValue</tt> be
		the last two digits of your Blackboard username (long number usually starting with 
		2011....) and set your favorite part of the color to that number (and the other 
		two values to zero, as above).  
		So, for example, if the last two digits of your username were 59 and your favorite
		color is blue, you would use <tt>startingValue = 59</tt> and <tt>color_rgb(0,0,startingValue)</tt>.
		Your program should display at least 100 objects
		(circles, rectangles, or what ever you choose).  The first object should be your
		favorite color with <tt>startingValue</tt>.  The last object should have the 
		same color with <tt>startingValue</tt> replaced by 255.  The object should get
		increasingly lighter.
		
		Hint:  Use <tt>(255-startingValue)</tt> objects and then you can let the color increase
		by 1 each time.  To give a smooth transition, use the <tt>setOutline()</tt>
		function on your object to make the outline color match (the default is white outlines on 
		objects).
		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 22 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Modify the program <tt>triangle.py</tt> from the textbook (also available at the 
		author's website) to draw a <b>5-sided polygon or pentagon</b> from 5 points 
		clicked on by the user.	
					
	<li> <b>Due Date: 23 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
 		Modify the bouncing ball problem (from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>) to 
		``wrap'' around the screen twice.  That is, when the ball gets to the right end of the 
		screen, have it continue on the left hand side.  Hint:  use the remainder operator (%)
		to make sure that the y-coordinate is always between 0 and the width of the window.

<hr>
	<li> <b>Due Date: 3 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Write a program that takes twenty mouse clicks from the user and draws a polygon
		whose corners, or vertices, are the clicked points.  Hint:  use the program you
		wrote for <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> and add a line from the last point clicked
		to the first point clicked.
		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 4 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Write a program that takes two mouse clicks from the user and draws rectangle
		whose corners include the two points clicked.
			
	<li> <b>Due Date: 5 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Modify the <tt>decodeMessage.py</tt> program from <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>
		to use an offset entered by the user to encrypt the message.  The program in the
		lab encrypts each character by the character 2 places ahead in the alphabet.  Your
		program should ask the user for the offset and encrypt their string by replacing
		each character by one that is <i>offset</i> places ahead in the alphabet.
		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 6 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for a list of prices of items purchased and 
		prints out each price and the total, formatted nicely. Here is a 
		sample run of the program:
		<pre>
Please enter the prices:  2.34, .99, 100, 81.05, 90
		
Your receipt:
         2.34
         0.99
       100.00
        81.05
        90.00
----------------
Total: 274.38	
		</pre>
		(Hint:  use the <tt>format()</tt> statement discussed in Chapter 5.)
					
	<li> <b>Due Date: 7 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>

		Make a list of at least 5 different places that you like to visit (these should
		be places that you would like to visit and not identical to others' lists or
		it will be picked up by the cheat-checking programs).  
		
		<p>
		Your program should print out the list regularly and vertically.  For example,
		<pre>
['San Francisco', 'Christchurch ', 'Sydney       ', 'Bangkok      ', 'Copenhagen   ']
S  C  S  B  C  
a  h  y  a  o  
n  r  d  n  p  
   i  n  g  e  
F  s  e  k  n  
r  t  y  o  h  
a  c     k  a  
n  h        g  
c  u        e  
i  r        n  
s  c           
c  h           
o   		</pre>
		
		Hint:  if you have a list of strings, <tt>places</tt>, then <tt>places[0][i]</tt>
		refers to the ith character of the first word in your list.  Start by printing
		out the first place name vertically, then add in the others.
	
		
			
<hr>
	<li> <b>Due Date: 10 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that uses your full name and prints it to the screen, cycling
		through the string.  You must store your name in a string and use a loop to 
		print out the answer.  For example, if your name was "Herbert H. Lehman", the 
		print out would be:
		
<pre>
H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n
e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n H
r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n H e

</pre>

		<tt>Too similar to the one above?</tt>
	

		
	<li> <b>Due Date: 11 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks for a list of names and a list of cities, as well as
		a file.  Your program should use the file as a template to generate letters 
		customized with the names and cities entered.  You should 
		generate a letter for each name/address pair on the inputted lists.
		The customized letters should replace
		every the <tt>**INSERT NAME HERE**</tt> with the name and <tt>**INSERT ADDRESS HERE**</tt>
		with the address.

		<p>
		For example, if the file <tt>inputTemplate.txt</tt> contained:

		<pre>
						New York, New York
						11 March 2013
	
**INSERT NAME HERE**
**INSERT ADDRESS HERE**

Dear **INSERT NAME HERE**,

Thank you for your service to New York City, and,
in particular, to the education of its residents.
Those in **INSERT ADDRESS HERE** appreciate it!

Best wishes to **INSERT NAME HERE** and your family,

	<li> <b>Due Date: 12 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file and a line length.
		Your program should then "wrap" all lines that are longer than line length,
		and print the result on the screen.
		For example, if the file contains:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789012345
This line has more than 20 characters.
This one has less 
And this one has lots, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		and the user entered the length of 20, all lines longer than 20 would 
		be wrapped to the next line:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789
012345	
This line has more t
han 20 characters.
This one has less 
And this one has lot
s, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		Hint:  break the problem in to parts:  first write a program that will print lines
		from a file to the screen (see <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6<a>).  Then modify 
		your initial program to only print lines up to the length entered.  And, to finish
		the program, then add in the code that prints lines that are longer than the length 
		entered.

	<p>where the first line describes the columns and each subsequent line of
	the file describes the stock price on a given day, separated by commas.  
	Note that the historical
	data (from Nasdaq) lists the information in reverse chronological order, while
	graphs of financial data always start with the oldest date first.  Your graph
	should have the oldest date on the left, progressing to the newest date on 
	the right.  
	
	<p>
	Hint:  You may assume that the price of any stock is positive and below $1000, so, the
	y-coordinates of your window should between 0 and 1000.  You may also assume that you are
	graphing data from one year.  There are at most 52 weeks * 5 business days/week = 260 
	days per year, so your x-coordinates should range from 0 to 260 (or a bit extra to make
	it look nice).

		<li> Have your turtle turn 90 degrees to the left so that the "fern" will draw
			upwards.
		<li> You can have the turtle draw faster by using the <tt>speed()</tt> function
			from the turtle module.
		<li>  Implement the algorithm above.  Do not search the internet for python code
			and submit that.  Not only is that plagiarism (and will earn you a grade of 0
			for the assignment), it will likely not implement the same fern as above, since
			there are many, many different variants of this fractal drawing.
	</ul>
