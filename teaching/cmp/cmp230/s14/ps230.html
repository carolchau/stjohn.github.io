<h3>General Notes</h3>

<a id="week1"></a>
<ul>
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description,
		contain a <tt>main()</tt> function and an invocation of the main at the end of the file:
		For example:
	<pre>
#Name: Herbert H. Lehman
#Date: February 4, 2013
#This program prints: hello world

def main():
	print("Hello world")
	
main()
	</pre>
	<li> About one of every five submitted programs will be chosen, at random, for complete grading.	
	<li> You are encouraged to submit your assignments early.  Below lists the 
		last date on which each assignment will be accepted.
		Assignments must be 
		<b>submitted before midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> <b>No credit will be given for an assignment submitted late. </b>
	<li> Extra credit will be awarded for the programs that are chosen for complete grading 
	that are submitted early. If a graded 
	program is submitted more than 12 hours early, 1 extra credit point will be awarded. For 
	graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early, 2 extra credit points will be awarded. 
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
	<li>For more information on using Blackboard, see the <a href="lab1.html">first 
lab</a>.
	<li> While you are encouraged to work with others, <b>all work submitted must be your own.</b>  As 
	a rule of thumb, you must do your own typing.  If it is not from the book or class webpage and
	you did not type it, it is plagiarism.  
	For the first incident, your grade will be a 0 for the assignment (even for cases 
	where you typed the program but others submitted it as their own).  For the second incident of 
	cheating or plagiarism, you will fail the class.  We report all incidents to the Office of Student Affairs.

	<li> Learning programming is like learning a foreign language:  you will learn more (with 
	less work) if you practice every day.  Some of the programs below are easy; some will take
	more time.  Set aside a block of time every day to work on programming.  If you complete the
	program for that day, go on to the next with your remaining time.
<ul>
</div>

		For example, if your first name is <tt>Eric</tt>, you would use <tt>Euros</tt>.  From
		the table above, we have that one dollar is worth 0.77 euros.
		You should begin the program by printing out your name.
		On each line, your program should write the number of dollars and the corresponding
		number of your currency.  For example:
		<pre>
Eric's converting program
		
Dollars:    Euros:
1           0.77
2           1.53
3           2.3
4           3.07
5           3.84
		</pre>
		Your program should print the information for 1, 2, ..., 10 dollars.  You do 
		not need to worry about formatting (we will talk about that more in Chapter 5), 
		but you do need to calculate all 10 entries.  
		Hint:  modify the program from the <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>.

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 10 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
	Write a program that asks the user for distance in feet and prints the number of 
		yards and feet (assume that there are 3 feet to the yard).  
		For example, if
		the user entered, 10, your program would output, <tt>3 yards 1 feet</tt>.
		Note that you should use "yards" and "feet" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect). 

	
	<li style="color:#999"> 
		<b>Oops, we assigned this too soon!  No homework due today, and we'll do this question
		in a few weeks after we discuss string methods.</b>
		<br>
		Due Date: 11 February  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program that measures strings in terms of the length of your name.  For
		example, if your first name is "Kate", you would use the length of the string 
		"Kate" which is 4.  If your name is "Daniel", you would use the length 6.
		
		<p>Your program should print out <b>your name</b> to the screen and then ask the user
		to enter a string.  You should then print out how long the string is in terms of
		the length of your name (that is, the length of the user's string divided by
		your length).  For example,
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Kate"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 2.25 Kate's long.
		</pre>
	While, if your name was Daniel, your program would look like:
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Daniel"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 1.8333 Daniel's long.
		</pre>		
		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 13 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Built into python is a module for simple drawing, called Turtle graphics.  To 
		use the Turtle graphics module, you must import it, just like with the math module.
		Some basic turtle commands are:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>left(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>right(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>forward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
			<li> <tt>backward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
		</ul>
		
		The following draws a 4-sided figure or square:
		<pre>
import turtle

def main():
    daniel = turtle.Turtle()    #Set up a turtle named "daniel"
    myWin = turtle.Screen()     #The graphics window

    #Draw a square
    for i in range(4):
        daniel.forward(100)     #Move forward 10 steps
        daniel.right(90)        #Turn 90 degrees to the right

    myWin.exitonclick()         #Close the window when clicked
    
main()		
		</pre>
		
		Modify this program to draw a <b>6-sided figure or hexagon</b>.  Make sure to 
		include the standard introductory comments at the beginning of your program
		as well as to <b>change the name of the turtle to your name.</b>

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 14 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Use turtle graphics to draw a multi-pointed star.  Your star must have at least
		10 points (or outer corners) and the lines must cross in the middle,
		and the starting and ending points should be the same.
		Here are some examples:
		
		<img  src="stars.jpg">
		
		<br>
		(Hint:  experiment with different angles and different numbers of lines 
		until you have a star with the starting and ending points lined up.)

<a id="week3"></a>
<hr>
		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 18 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Write a program to calculate how much money you would have if your money was cut
		in half
		every day.  Your program should ask the user for the number of days and display
		the amount of money for each day.  The starting amount of money is $1000.
		Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter the number of days:  5
Day 1:  $1000
Day 2:  $500
Day 3:  $250
Day 4:  $125
Day 5:  $62.5
		</pre>	
	
		(Do not worry about formatting the amounts.  We will discuss how to do that well 
		in Chapter 5.)
		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 20 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 3</b><br>
		Modify the book's factorial program to calculate the <i>double factorial</i>.  
		The double factorial is similar to the factorial, except you multiply every other 
		number.  For example, <tt>5!! = 5 * 3 * 1</tt> and <tt>8!! = 8 * 6 * 4 * 2</tt>.
		Formally, <tt>n!! = n*(n-2)*(n-4)*...*(1)</tt>.
		(Hint:  you only need to change the <tt>range</tt> statement.)

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 21 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Modify the bouncing ball example from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a> so that the ball 
		bounces a little bit less each time.  At the end, it should appear to roll across the
		x-axis.  	(Hint:  the only change needed is to the height of the ball.  How can
		you make the height get smaller as time increases?)	

<a id="week4"></a>
<hr>

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 24 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Using Zelle's graphics module, draw your initials-- the first letters of your 
		names.  Your display should contain at least 6 different objects (if the letters
		in your name can be displayed with less, add extra objects for decoration.
		
	
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 25 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Using Zelle's graphics module, draw a snow-person.  Your display should contain 3 or 
		more circles forming the
		body, as well as shapes for the mouth and eyes.  Use the <tt>Text</tt> object
		to include your name in the picture.
		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 26 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Modify the program <tt>triangle.py</tt> from the textbook (also available at the 
		author's website) to draw a <b>5-sided polygon or pentagon</b> from 5 points 
		clicked on by the user.	

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 27 February</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Write a program that takes two mouse clicks from the user and draws rectangle
		whose corners include the two points clicked.

<a id="week5"></a>
<hr>


	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 3 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
		Write a program that takes twenty mouse clicks from the user and draws a polygon
		whose corners, or vertices, are the clicked points.  Hint:  use the program you
		wrote for <a href="lab4.html">Lab 4</a> and add a line from the last point clicked
		to the first point clicked.						
	
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 4 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 4</b><br>
 		Modify the bouncing ball problem (from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>) to 
		``wrap'' around the screen twice.  That is, when the ball gets to the right end of the 
		screen, have it continue on the left hand side.  Hint:  use the remainder operator (%)
		to make sure that the x-coordinate is always between 0 and the width of the window.
		The default value for the <tt>veloc</tt> variable matches the periodicity (how often
		the function repeats itself).  If you change it to .49, it will be easier to see 
		the wrapping (since the ball won't be in the exact path same path the second time 
		through).
	

	<li style="color:#999"> 
		<b>Due Date: 5 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
		Write a program that measures strings in terms of the length of your name.  For
		example, if your first name is "Kate", you would use the length of the string 
		"Kate" which is 4.  If your name is "Daniel", you would use the length 6.
		
		<p>Your program should print out <b>your name</b> to the screen and then ask the user
		to enter a string.  You should then print out how long the string is in terms of
		the length of your name (that is, the length of the user's string divided by
		your length).  For example,
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Kate"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 2.25 Kate's long.
		</pre>
	While, if your name was Daniel, your program would look like:
		<pre>
The measuring string is "Daniel"
Please enter a string:  Hello world
Your string is 1.8333 Daniel's long.
		</pre>		


			
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 6 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Modify the <tt>encode.py</tt> program from <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a>
		to use an offset entered by the user to encrypt the message.  The program in the
		lab encrypts each character by the character 1 place ahead in the alphabet.  Your
		program should ask the user for the offset and encrypt their string by replacing
		each character by one that is <i>offset</i> places ahead in the alphabet.	

<a id="week6"></a>				
<hr>
		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 10 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for a list of prices of items purchased and 
		prints out each price and the total, formatted nicely. Here is a 
		sample run of the program:
		<pre style="color:#999">
Please enter the prices:  2.34, .99, 100, 81.05, 90
		
Your receipt:
         2.34
         0.99
       100.00
        81.05
        90.00
----------------
Total: 274.38	
		</pre>
		(Hint:  use the <tt>format()</tt> statement discussed in Chapter 5.)


					
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 12 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>

		Make a list of at least 5 different places that you like to visit (these should
		be places that you would like to visit and not identical to others' lists or
		it will be picked up by the cheat-checking programs).  
		
		<p>
		Your program should print out the list regularly and vertically.  For example,
		<pre>
['San Francisco', 'Christchurch ', 'Sydney       ', 'Bangkok      ', 'Copenhagen   ']
S  C  S  B  C  
a  h  y  a  o  
n  r  d  n  p  
   i  n  g  e  
F  s  e  k  n  
r  t  y  o  h  
a  c     k  a  
n  h        g  
c  u        e  
i  r        n  
s  c           
c  h           
o   		</pre>
		
		Hint:  if you have a list of strings, <tt>places</tt>, then <tt>places[0][i]</tt>
		refers to the ith character of the first word in your list.  Start by printing
		out the first place name vertically, then add in the others.
	
		
			

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 13 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that uses your full name and prints it to the screen, cycling
		through the string.  You must store your name in a string and use a loop to 
		print out the answer.  For example, if your name was "Herbert H. Lehman", the 
		print out would be:
		
<pre>
H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n
e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n H
r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n H e
b e r t   H .   L e h m a n H e r
e r t   H .   L e h m a n H e r b
r t   H .   L e h m a n H e r b e
t   H .   L e h m a n H e r b e r 
  H .   L e h m a n H e r b e r t 
H .   L e h m a n H e r b e r t   
.   L e h m a n H e r b e r t   H 
  L e h m a n H e r b e r t   H .  
L e h m a n H e r b e r t   H .   
e h m a n H e r b e r t   H .   L 
h m a n H e r b e r t   H .   L e 
m a n H e r b e r t   H .   L e h 
a n H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m 
n H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a
</pre>

		HInt:  one way to approach this is to store the name with the spaces:
		<pre>"H e r b e r t   H .   L e h m a n"</pre>

	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 17 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for a name of a file and then prints to 
		the screen the number of characters and lines in the file.
		Hint:  see <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6.</a>


	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 18 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file and a line length.
		Your program should then "wrap" all lines that are longer than line length,
		and print the result on the screen.
		For example, if the file contains:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789012345
This line has more than 20 characters.
This one has less 
And this one has lots, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		and the user entered the length of 20, all lines longer than 20 would 
		be wrapped to the next line:
		<pre>
01234567890123456789
012345	
This line has more t
han 20 characters.
This one has less 

And this one has lot
s, lots, lots, more than 20 characters!
		</pre>
		Hint:  break the problem in to parts:  first write a program that will print lines
		from a file to the screen (see <a href="lab6.html">Lab 6<a>).  Then modify 
		your initial program to only print lines up to the length entered.  And, to finish
		the program, then add in the code that prints lines that are longer than the length 
		entered.  Note you will have extra blank lines, if a short line is entered (we will 
		discuss how to print different things depending on the length when we discuss 
		decisions in Chapter 7) and you do not have to worry about lines being longer than
		40 characters (i.e.  no need to wrap a line more than once).
		

					
	

		
	<li style="color:#999"> <b>Due Date: 20 March</b>  <b style="float:right">Reading: Chapter 5</b><br>
	
		Write a program that asks for a list of names and a list of cities, as well as
		a file.  Your program should use the file as a template to generate letters 
		customized with the names and cities entered.  You should 
		generate a letter for each name/address pair on the inputted lists.
		The customized letters should replace
		every the <tt>**INSERT NAME HERE**</tt> with the name and <tt>**INSERT ADDRESS HERE**</tt>
		with the address.

		<p style="color:#999">
		For example, if the file <tt>inputTemplate.txt</tt> contained:

		<pre>
						New York, New York
						11 March 2013
	
**INSERT NAME HERE**
**INSERT ADDRESS HERE**

Dear **INSERT NAME HERE**,

Thank you for your service to New York City, and,
in particular, to the education of its residents.
Those in **INSERT ADDRESS HERE** appreciate it!

Best wishes to **INSERT NAME HERE** and your family,

		Fixing the line:  Many systems decide who goes first based on priority.
		For example, the registration process at Lehman gives priority for students with 
		more credits.  Similarly, printer queues (lines) let a printing job with 
		higher priority go first.  Write a function that takes a list of priorities (a list
		of numbers).  The function should then compare the zero-th entry to the first
		entry, and interchange them if the first is bigger than the second.  The function 
		should continue comparing subsequent entries until it gets to the end of the list.  
		
		<p>For example, a call to the function, <tt>fixLine([9,2,15,7,1])</tt> will
		first compare <tt>l[0] = 9</tt> to <tt>l[1] = 2</tt>.  Since <tt>2</tt> is less 
		than <tt>9</tt>, your function should interchange the two entries, resulting in 
		the list:
		<pre>
		[2,9,15,7,1]
		</pre>
		Next, your function should compare <tt>l[1] = 9</tt> to <tt>l[2] = 15</tt>.  <tt>15</tt>
		is bigger than <tt>9</tt>, so, there is no need to interchange them, and the list
		stays the same:
		<pre>
		[2,9,15,7,1]
		</pre>
		Continuing, the function compares <tt>l[2] = 15</tt> to <tt>l[3] = 7</tt> and 
		interchanges them:
		<pre>
		[2,9,7,15,1]
		</pre>
		The process repeats with <tt>l[3] = 15</tt> and <tt>l[4] = 1</tt>, resulting in:
		<pre>
		[2,9,7,1,15]
		</pre>		
	
		<p> Note that your function will only fix the largest entry's position in line
		(if you run it repeatedly, it will put the rest of the entries in order).
		
		<p> Write a main function that will ask the user to enter a list of numbers
		(separated by commas) and then pass that list to your function.  The main 
		function should then print out the list resulting from your function.

	<b>This is the make-up problem for #28.  The score from the problem below can 
	replace your grade for #28.</b>
	
	<p>For this problem, you will read and graph values from a CSV file.  A CSV file is a "Comma-Separated File," in which the values on each line are separated from each other by commas.  Problem 28 used an example of a CSV file.  This kind of file is used to represent data from all sorts of activities, to be downloaded from the Web.

	<p>Your file will contain labels for the x axis in the first row and labels for the y axis in the first column.  All other values will be numbers, which may or may not be contained in quotes.
     
	<p>Write a function that accepts a line from a CSV file and returns a list of numbers.    The numbers may or may not be contained in single or double quotes.  This function should work for any CSV file in which the first column contains labels and the rest contain only numbers.

	<p>The sample file we are providing represents sectors of the gross domestic product from the first quarter of 2002 to the last quarter of 2012. Each line of the file represents one sector of the economy (Consumption, Investment, Net Exports, Government, and Residual).  The first row of the file contains labels for the time periods (I2002 for first quarter of 2002, II2002 for second quarter of 2002, etc.), the first column contains labels for the sectors.   

	<p>Next, write a main program that uses the function to create several graphs, each 
graph representing a single line of the CSV file.  Numeric values appear in row 2, column 2 through the last row and last column, but they may be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.  

	<p>For example, if you read the file:

<pre>
Time period,  I2002, II2002,III2002, IV2002,  I2003, II2003,III2003, IV2003
GDP,11467.1,11528.1,11586.6,11590.6,11638.9,11737.5,11930.7,12038.6
