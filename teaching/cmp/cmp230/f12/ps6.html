<p>
This assignment focuses on functions from Chapter 6.
</p>
</div>


<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Chapter 6, #1 (Hint: use a function with two input parameters for the animal and the related sound)
	<li> Modify the program from <a href="lab7.html">Lab 7</a> to allow the user to enter two 
		different mathematical functions to be graphed.  Your program should then display
		both on in the graphics window.
	<li> Fill in the missing function definitions for this program:
<pre>
def main(): 
    welcome()              #Prints "Hello, world" to the screen 
    x,y = userInput()      #Asks user for 2 inputs and returns numbers entered 
    d = calculate(x,y)     #Returns the difference of the parameters
    displayResults(x,y,d)  #Prints the two inputs, and d
    
main() 
</pre>
That is, write the functions <tt>welcome()</tt>, <tt>userInput()</tt>, <tt>calculate()</tt> and 
<tt>displayResults()</tt>.  Include all functions, including the <tt>main()</tt> above in the file
you submit.
	<li> Write a function that takes as a parameter a list of strings and returns a list containing 
	the first letter of each of the strings.<br>
	That is, if the input parameter is <tt>["Daniel","Nashyl","Orla","Simone","Zakaria"]</tt>, 
	your function should return <tt>["D", "N", "O", "S", "Z"]</tt>.
	The file you submit should include a <tt>main()</tt> function that demonstrates that your
	function works.
	<li> Write a function that takes as a parameter a list of strings and returns a list containing 
	the lengths of each of the strings.
That is, if the input parameter is <tt>["Daniel","Nashyl","Orla","Simone","Zakaria"]</tt>, 
	your function should return <tt>[6, 6, 4, 6, 7]</tt>.
	The file you submit should include a <tt>main()</tt> function that demonstrates that your
	function works.
</ol>
