Submitted identical programs, down to the line spacing: (the "drawTri(t,l,d)" version):

Danny Benalcazar
Christian Chandi 	(added one extra line:  # This program achieves the Kotch snowflake)
Bertha Gallo
Jason Hollingsworth
Al Mamun
Dariana Reyes
Joseph Rojas
Mujiba Shaila


Richard Roeung and Rezarta Veliu submitted identical programs, except for comments,
that drew stars.  

"Submitted a program identical (except for comments) to another student.  Program drew
star, not fractal snowflake."

Similar also to Brett K.  (no name, but file problemset10question5.py)




Suspicious:

Similar, but hard to prove (the "drawTriangle(t,l,x)" version):

Clester Bailey
Brandan Buddy 	(added in extra blank lines)
Anthony Merino
Evadne Smith-McLilley

Alberto Espinal & Carol Gonzalez:

Turned in a identical programs where the first part is level 3 and the next 
two sides are at level 2.  Some spacing added, but identical almost everywhere.

Spacing similar to Bhandari.




Odd:

Sela A.,  Christian Fadul, and Brett Krutiansky submitted spiral program for #5

Veliu, Richard Roeung, Brett Krutiansky
Submitted very similar stars
