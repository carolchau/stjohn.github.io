Today's lab focuses on sorting and searching (Chapter 13).

<h3>Sorting Visualization</h3>

The on-line lecture (available on Blackboard) focuses on the searching and 
sorting.  This lab has visualizations of the sorts covered in the lecture.
Download the <a href="sortGUI.py">sortGUI.py</a> file to your machine and
run it.  Remember, that it will need the <tt>graphics.py</tt> file in the
same directory.

<p>
The program generates 40 random numbers and first sorts the list with 
the <b>selectionSort</b> algorithm from the textbook.  The code has been modified 
slightly from the book to update the graphics display as it runs.
When the program runs, it repeatedly traverses the list.  On its first 
traversal of the list, it finds the largest number and then interchanges it
with the last number in the list.  It then repeats looking for the next 
largest number and puts that in the second-to-last position in the list.
It keeps going putting the next largest number in its place until the whole
list is sorted.  Run the program several times, paying attention to the 
first sort only.  Can you see the largest number moving each time?

<p>
Next, the program generates 40 random numbers and sorts the list with the 
<b>mergeSort</b> algorithm from the textbook.  mergeSort has a very different
strategy:
<ul>
	<li> split the list in half,
	<li> sort each half, and 
	<li> merge the sorted halves back together
</ul>
To sort each half, the function calls itself (mergeSort) to perform the
sort.  This is an example of <b>recursion</b>, which just means a function
that calls itself.  For our list of 40 numbers, this means the program 
will split the list in half, sort the first 20 numbers, then the next
20 numbers, and merge the results back to form a single sorted list.  
Run the program several times, paying attention to the end of the second sort.
You can see the first sorted half and the second sorted half merging to form
a single sorted list.  If you run the program again, and look earlier, you 
can see the left half of the left side (first 10 slots) and the right half 
of the left side (next 10 slots), being merged together to form a sorted
list of the first half.  

<p>mergeSort is very fast but harder to implement in code.  selectionSort
is slower to run but easier to implement.

<h3>BubbleSort</h3>

Today, we are going to implement another sort, called <b>bubbleSort</b>.
While bubbleSort is the most efficient way to sort big lists (
<a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8">President 
Obama on the subject</a>, 
<a href="http://overstated.net/2008/02/11/obama-not-bubble-sort">comments</a>), it is easy 
to understand.

<p>Algorithms are often written in <b>pseudo-code,</b> which is an 
informal, high-level description:
<pre>
func bubblesort( var a as array )
    for i from 2 to N
        for j from 0 to N - 2
           if a[j] > a[j + 1]
              swap( a[j], a[j + 1] )
end func
</pre>
(from <a href="http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Bubble_sort">www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Bubble_sort</a>)

<p>
Let's translate this line-by-line into python:
<ul>
	<li>
<pre>
func bubblesort( var a as array )
    for i from 2 to N
        for j from 0 to N - 2
           if a[j] > a[j + 1]
              swap( a[j], a[j + 1] )
end func
</pre>	
	<li>
<pre>
func bubblesort( var a as array )
</pre>	
This first lines says we have a function with an array variable called <tt>a</tt>.
In python, we define functions with the <tt>def</tt> keyword:
<pre>
	def bubbleSort(a):
</pre>
	<li>
<pre>
    for i from 2 to N
</pre>	
This next line is a <tt>for</tt> loop, but what is <tt>N</tt>?  Usually, <tt>N</tt>
or <tt>n</tt> refers to the length of the list, so, let's set that up as a variable
first, then write out the for loop:
<pre>
	N = len(a)
	for i in range(2, N+1):
</pre>
Note that their for loop goes from 0 upto and including N, so, we need to change
the range accordingly.

	<li>
<pre>
        for j from 0 to N - 2
</pre>	
Since we have <tt>N</tt> defined, we can easily write out this for-loop:
<pre>	
		for j in range(N-1):
</pre>

	<li>
<pre>
           if a[j] > a[j + 1]
</pre>	
We need one small addition to make this line proper python:
<pre>
		   if a[j] > a[j+1]:
</pre>
	<li>
<pre>
              swap( a[j], a[j + 1] )
</pre>	
Lastly, we need to swap the two values.  In python, we can do this in one line 
with simultaneous assignment:
<pre>
			  a[j],a[j+1] = a[j+1],a[j]
</pre>

</ul>

Putting this altogether, we have:
<pre>
	def bubbleSort(a):
		N = len(a)
		for i in range(2,N+1):
			for j in range(N-1):
				if a[j] > a[j+1]:
					a[j],a[j+1] = a[j+1],a[j]
</pre>


To make this function show the graphics, we will add two calls to the <tt>drawBox()</tt>
as well as to <tt>sleep()</tt> (to slow it down enough to see):
<pre>
	def bubbleSort(a,w):
		N = len(a)
		for i in range(2,N+1):
			for j in range(N-1):
				if a[j] > a[j+1]:
					a[j],a[j+1] = a[j+1],a[j]
					drawBox(a, j, w)
                	drawBox(a, j+1,w)
            	time.sleep(.1)
</pre>
Note that we need to add <tt>w</tt>, the graphics window variable,
to the formal parameters of our function
so that we can use it when calling our drawing function.


<p>Add the <tt>bubbleSort()</tt> above to your program and try running it.
Can you see the largest value "bubble" up to the top?

<p>After completing your program, go to <tt>Assignments</tt> in Blackboard
and click on the link: <tt>Lab 11</tt>.  Use the file upload interface
to upload your program.  Remember to click the <tt>Submit</tt> button before
closing the lab exercise.
