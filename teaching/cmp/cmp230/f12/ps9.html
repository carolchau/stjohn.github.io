<p>
This assignment focuses on design and simulation from Chapter 9.
</p>
</div>


<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Modify the stock simulation from <a href="lab10.html">Lab 10</a> to calculate
	and print the average ending value of money.

	
	<li> Is it likely that a monkey at a typewriter, randomly choosing character,
	could write Hamlet?
	
	<p>
	Write a simulation to answer this question.  That is, write a program that will 
	randomly generate 100,000 strings of length 5 and count the number of strings 
	that match "to be".  You may assume that your strings are lower case letters 
	and spaces only.  That is, when you generate your string, you are choosing 
	from the 27 characters: [' ','a','b','c','d',...'y','z']
	
	<li> 
	
	A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellwether#States">bellweather</a> state is one that 
	has voted with the winner over past elections.  
	For example, both Ohio and Nevada have voted for the presidential winner in all the elections
	since 1980.  
	
	<p>
	Write a function to simulate the voting of the 50 states.  Your function should take
	as input the number of elections to simulate, and then simulate the elections in the 50 states,
	assuming that each has 50% probability of voting for the winner.
	
	<p>In your <tt>main()</tt> function in your program, you should call your function 1000 times
	with the input parameter values:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10, and print out the number of bellweather
	states you would expect for each number of elections.  
	That is, your output should look like:
	
	<pre>
	Number of Elections      Number of Bellweather states
	1                        your calculation goes here!
	2                        your calculation goes here!
	3                        your calculation goes here!
	4                        your calculation goes here!
	5                        your calculation goes here!
	9                        your calculation goes here! 
	10                       your calculation goes here!
	</pre>
	
	
	<li> Chapter 9, #13 (random walk)
	<li> Chapter 9, #14 (graphical random walk) 
</ol>

<h3>General Notes</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Two of the five submitted programs will be chosen at random for grading.  
	<li> Assignments must be <b>submitted by midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description.
	<li> No credit will be given for a late assignment. 
	<li> Extra credit will be awarded for graded programs that are submitted early. If a graded 
	program is submitted more than 12 hours early (before Friday noon), 1 extra credit point will be awarded. For 
	graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early (Thursday or earlier), 2 extra credit points will be awarded. 
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
