<h3>Pricing Options</h3>


<p>An <b>option</b> in financial markets is a contract that allows you to buy (but does not 
require you to buy) at a set price
on a set date in the future.  For example, if you have an option to buy Apple stock at $700
per share
on December 1, then if Apple stock is at $720, then you can use the option and make $20 per
share.  If the Apple stock is $680, then since the contract only gives you the option of 
buying the shares, you can ignore it.

<p>Companies work hard to price options to maximize their profits.  The program for today is
to write a program that calculates some of what's needed to price options.  
A common way to price options is to use the
Black Scholes model (we won't go into how the model works, but if you are interested there
are many sites that explain more about options and pricing models such as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes">this wiki page</a> 
and <a href="http://richnewman.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/a-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-the-black-scholes-option-pricing-formula-part-1/">beginner's guide</a>)

The relevant formulas (from <a href="http://richnewman.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/a-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-the-black-scholes-option-pricing-formula-part-1/">beginner's guide</a>)
are:<br>

<!--
\begin{align}
C(S,t) &amp;= N(d_1)~S-N(d_2)~K e^{-r(T-t)},\\
d_1 &amp;= \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S}{K}\right)+\left(r+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}\\
d_2 &amp;= \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S}{K}\right)+\left(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}} = d_{1}-\sigma\sqrt{T-t}.
\end{align}
-->
where C is the cost of the option that we are calculating.  S, T, and K are inputs that represent
the current cost of the stock, the time until maturity, and the strike (the fixed price in the future)
of the stock, respectively.  N() is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal 
distribution, r is the risk free rate, and &sigma; (sigma) is volatility of the underlying asset.

<p>That's a lot of math!  Python has a built-in library that contains many commonly used math
functions already defined for you.  We will use them to define d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub>.  
(the cost C can also be <a href="http://www.espenhaug.com/black_scholes.html">calculated</a> using 
only the math library but requires some understanding of statistics,
so, we won't do it here).

<p>To use the math library, you need to include a line in your python file:
<pre>
import math
</pre>
which tells the python intepreter to include all the functions in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.0.1/library/math.html">math library</a>.
(You can also use <tt> from math import * </tt>.)  

<p>Looking at the equations for d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub>, we will need to 
calculate logarithm and square roots.  For example to find the logarithm of S/K, we would write:
<pre>	
	math.log(S/K)
</pre>
and to find the square root of T, we would write:
<pre>
	math.sqrt(T)
</pre>
Let's put this altogether in a program to compute d_1:
<pre>
# Lab 3: calculating option pricing
# Your name here

def optionPricing():
	S,T,K,r,sigma = eval(input("Enter values for the stock price, maturity time, strike price, risk free rate, and volatility (separated by commas):"))
	d1 = (math.log(S/K) + (r + sigma*sigma/2 )*T ) / (sigma*math.sqrt(T))
	print("d1 is", d1)


# Run your program:
optionPricing()
</pre>
Remember when writing mathematics in python to use * for multiplication and to use parenthesis to 
group terms together.  Test your program with a stock price of 100, maturity time of 1, strike price
of 200, risk free rate of 2.5, and volatility of .1 (10%) (your program should display 18.1185281944).

<p>Now, extend your program to calculate and display d<sub>2</sub>.  For the test case above, you should 
print out 18.0185281944 for d<sub>2</sub>.  Save this file to submit to Blackboard.

<h3>Bouncing Ball</h3>

<p>Included with the textbook is a <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/">simple graphics
library</a>.  To use it, place the file <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py">graphics.py</a>
to the directory where you saved your python files.  There is a useful <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.pdf">cheat sheet</a>
of the graphics functions.

<p>
Here is the first program (inspired from <a href="http://www.motionscript.com/mastering-expressions/simulation-basics-1.html">motionscript.com</a>):
<pre>
#Idea from:  http://www.motionscript.com/mastering-expressions/simulation-basics-1.html

from math import *
from graphics import *
from time import *

def goodSine():
    veloc = .5  #horizontal velocity (pixels per second)
    amp = 50    #sine wave amplitude (pixels)
    freq = .01  #oscillations per second

    #Set up a graphics window:
    win = GraphWin("Good Sine Waves",400,200)
    win.setCoords(0.0, -100.0, 200.0, 100.0)

    #Draw a line for the x-axis:
    p1 = Point(0,0)
    p2 = Point(200,0)
    xAxis = Line(p1,p2)
    xAxis.draw(win)

    #Draw a ball that follows a sine wave
    for time in range(1000):
        x = time*veloc
        y = amp*sin(freq*time*2*pi)
        ball = Circle(Point(x,y),2)
        ball.draw(win)
        sleep(0.1)  #Needed so that animation runs slowly enough to be seen


    win.getMouse()
    win.close()

    
goodSine()
</pre>
Save this file to your USB or MyDocuments folder (along with <tt>graphics.py</tt>) and run the 
program.  Lets go through what each part does:
<ul>
	<li>	<pre>
from math import *
from graphics import *
from time import *
</pre>
	The <tt>import</tt> statement asks python to include the functions from a given module, or 
	collection of functions.  These three <tt>import</tt> statements ask for the functions from 
	the math, graphics, and time modules.  The math and time modules are built-in to python; the 
	graphics module was written by Zelle, the textbook's author.
	<li>	<pre>
    veloc = .5  #horizontal velocity (pixels per second)
    amp = 50    #sine wave amplitude (pixels)
    freq = .01  #oscillations per second
</pre>
	These three variables control the speed, height, and bounce of the ball.  Try changing them 
	and see what happens to the animation.  Your goal is to have the ball touch the ceiling every
	time.

	<li>	<pre>
    #Set up a graphics window:
    win = GraphWin("Good Sine Waves",400,200)
    win.setCoords(0.0, -100.0, 200.0, 100.0)
</pre>
	These lines set up the graphics window.  This window will have the title, "Good Sine Waves" and
	width 400 pixels and height 200 pixel.  A pixel is just one tiny light bulb in your computer's
	screen.  So, 400 pixels is 400 tiny lights in the screen.  You can assume that computers
	have screens that are at least 800 by 600 pixels.  In the graphics module, there is a function
	for changing the coordinates of a graphics window.  We did so here to make the math calculating
	the height of the bouncing ball easier.

	<li>	<pre>
    #Draw a line for the x-axis:
    p1 = Point(0,0)
    p2 = Point(200,0)
    xAxis = Line(p1,p2)
    xAxis.draw(win)
</pre>
	The graphics module has several standard shapes (see <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics/index.html">list
	of graphics objects</a>).  We created two points, called <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>, that will
	be the endpoints of a line called <tt>xAxis</tt>.  For our line to be seen, we need to draw
	it to our window (which we called <tt>win</tt>).  Since it is possible to have multiple windows
	in a given program, we need to include the name of our window as the input to the draw function.

	<li>	<pre>
    #Draw a ball that follows a sine wave
    for time in range(1000):
        x = time*veloc
        y = amp*sin(freq*time*2*pi)
        ball = Circle(Point(x,y),2)
        ball.draw(win)
        sleep(0.1)  #Needed so that animation runs slowly enough to be seen
</pre>
	This loop repeats the indented statements 1000 times.  First time through the variable <tt>time</tt>
	is 0; the next time through it is 1; and it keeps going until <tt>time</tt> is 999.  Each repetition
	of the loop sets the variable <tt>x</tt> to a multiple of <tt>time</tt> and sets the variable <tt>y</tt>
	to the <tt>sine</tt> of a multiple of <tt>time</tt>.  It then makes a circle centered at <tt>(x,y)</tt>
	and draws that circle (called <tt>ball</tt>) to the window.  Lastly, we have a call to the sleep
	function so that the animation runs slowly enough so we can see it.
	<li>	<pre>
    win.getMouse()
    win.close()
</pre>
	We add these lines at the end of our graphics programs to keep the window open.  The first 
	command is waiting for a mouse click.  After the mouse is clicked in the window, the next 
	statement is executed, <tt>win.close()</tt> which closes the window.
	<li>	<pre>
goodSine()
</pre>
	This is a call (or invocation) of the function <tt>goodSine()</tt> that we just wrote.  It is 
	not necessary to have in your file, but if you do, you do not have to type <tt>goodSine()</tt>
	in the Python shell to run your function.  Instead, it will be called when you use the F5 key.
</ul>

<p>
To make the ball appear to bounce, we need for it to stay above the line representing the x-axis.
Another way of saying that is its y-coordinate should always be positive.  A simple way to do 
that is to take the absolute value of the expression for the y variable:
<pre>
        y = abs(amp*sin(freq*time*2*pi))
</pre>
Try running your program to see the bouncing ball!
