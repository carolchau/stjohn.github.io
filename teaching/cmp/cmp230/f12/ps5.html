<p>
This assignment focuses on strings and files from Chapter 5.
</p>
</div>


<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li>  Modify the <tt>month.py</tt> program from the book (in the Chapter 5 directory of the
		book's zip file) to print out the full name of each month.  <br>
		<i>(Hint:  add extra spaces to the <tt>months</tt> string so that every month's name 
		takes up the same number of characters.)</i>
	<li> Write a program that asks the user for a sentence and prints the number of characters
		the user entered.		
	<li>  Write a program that asks the user for a word and returns the score of the word, following
		the scoring rules from the game <a href="http://www.scrabble.com">scrabble</a>.  For
		example:
		<pre> 
		Please enter a word:  quail
		Your score is 14.
		</pre>
		Scrabble gives most common letters a score of 1 and less common ones higher values
		(<tt>A=1 , B=3, C=3, D=2, E=1, F=4, G=2, H=4, I=1, J=8, K=5, L=1, M=3, N=1, O=1, P=3, Q=10, R=1, S=1, T=1,U=1, V=4, W=4, X=8, Y=4, and Z=10</tt>
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions</a>).  So, 
		the word <tt>quail</tt> above, has a score of <tt>10+1+1+1+1= 14</tt>
	<li> Write a program that asks the user for a sentence and prints the number of characters
		the user entered.
	<li> Write that asks the user for a file name. You may assume that the file has the following format:
<pre>
		12.3 10
		99 84.3
		0.3 20
</pre>		
	(two numbers per line). Your program should use a graphics window to display the information 
	in the file.  In particular, your program should read each line from the file and display a 
	point at the coordinates indicated. 
	If the first line is 12.3 10 should draw a small circle at (12.3, 10) on the graphics window. 
	
	<p>
	You may assume that all points have coordinates between 0 and 100 and set the coordinates of 
	the window to be bounded by 0 and 100 in both directions.   
	
	<p> Note that the file could have any number of lines in it.
