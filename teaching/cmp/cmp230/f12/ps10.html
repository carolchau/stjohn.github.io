<p>
This assignment focuses on basic searching and sorting from Chapter 13.
</p>
</div>


<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>

	<li> Write a program that asks the user for a name of a file, and a keyword
		and then prints out the first line the keyword appears. 
		<br>Note:  you can use the search from this chapter or built-in python 
		functions.
	
	<li> Modify the selectionSort (from Chapter 13 of the book or Zelle's website)
		to sort lists of string ignoring case.  For example, the list, 
		["Amy", "aardvark", "Amsterdam", "ape", "Alice"] should be 
		alphabetized as ["aardvark", "Alice", "Amsterdam", "Amy", "ape"].
		
	<li> Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm
		<pre>
function insertionSort(array A)
    for i from 1 to length[A]-1 do
        value := A[i] 
        j := i-1
        while j >= 0 and A[j] > value do
            A[j+1] := A[j]
            j := j-1
        done
        A[j+1] = value
    done
		</pre>
		(pseudocode from <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms/Insertion_sort">Rosetta Code</a>)
		
		<p>
		Write a main program that demonstrates that your insertion sort function works.
		<br>
		(Hint:  this does not have to be a graphics program, printing the list before and
		after is fine.)
		

	<li> Turtle graphics are a built-in module of python that allows you
		to draw by moving a "turtle" (the cursor) around the screen.  The
		basic functions are:
		<ul>
			<li> <tt>left(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>right(degs):</tt> turns your turtle left <tt>degs</tt> degrees
			<li> <tt>forward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
			<li> <tt>backward(s):</tt> moves your turtle forward <tt>s</tt> steps
		</ul>
		The following program uses recursion to draw a square spiral:
		<pre>
#From http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Recursion/graphical.html

import turtle

#This function draws a line, turns right, and calls itself
#  to draw a shorter line:
def drawSpiral(t,lineLength):
    if lineLength > 0:
        t.forward(lineLength)
        t.right(90)
        drawSpiral(t, lineLength-5)

def main():
    #Set up a turtle:
    myTurtle = turtle.Turtle()

    #Set up a graphics window:
    myWin = turtle.Screen()

    #Call the function that will draw a spiral
    drawSpiral(myTurtle,150)

    #After mouse click, close window
    myWin.exitonclick()

main()
		</pre>
		Modify the program so that it draws a <b>triangular</b> spiral.
		<br>
		(Hint: Think about the difference about between a square and a triangle.
		You only need to modify one line of code.)

	<li> Chapter 13, #8.  (Hint:  use the turtle module from above, instead
		of implementing each function as suggested in the last paragraph.)
		
</ol>

<h3>General Notes</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Two of the five submitted programs will be chosen at random for grading.  
	<li> Assignments must be <b>submitted by midnight</b> on the date due. 
	<li> Every program should begin with a comment that includes your name and a brief description.
	<li> No credit will be given for a late assignment. 
	<li> Extra credit will be awarded for graded programs that are submitted early. If a graded 
	program is submitted more than 12 hours early (before Friday noon), 1 extra credit point will be awarded. For 
	graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early (Thursday or earlier), 2 extra credit points will be awarded. 
	<li> Before submitting an assignment you are free to ask for help in class 
	(if your question might be of general interest), during office hours, and 
	by e-mail. Please take advantage of this.
