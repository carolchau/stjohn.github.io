</div>


<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Chapter 7, Problem #3, p 230 (exam grades).
	<li> Write a function that takes as a parameter the zone and returns the Long Island Railroad fare. 
		If the zone is 2 or smaller, the fare is 7.25. If the zone is 3, the fare is 8.75. 
		If the zone is greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 6, the fare is 10.00. 
		If the zone is greater than or equal to 7 and less than or equal to 8, the fare is 11.50. 
		If the zone is 9, the fare is 13.50. If the zone is greater than or equal to 10, the fare is 20.00.
	<li> Write a program that asks a user to enter a list of clothing items purchased.  Your program 
		should then calculate their total bill with tax.  In New York City, the tax on clothing items
		that priced $110 or less is 0%.  The tax on clothing items priced more than $110 is 8.5%.
		
		<p>
		Here is a sample run of the program:
		<pre>
		Please enter clothing prices, separated by commas:  100, 9.99, 200, 159.99
		
		Your receipt:
		    100.00
		      9.99
		    200.00  T
		    159.99  T
		 ---------
		    500.58 
		</pre>
		(The `T' indicates which items are taxed.  To make the receipt look nice, you can use 
		<tt>format()</tt> and <tt>rjust()</tt> functions.
	<li> Modify the <tt>decodeMessage.py</tt> program from <a href="lab5.html">Lab 5</a> which 
		encodes messages with lower case letters to one that can also encode messages with upper
		case letters and numbers.
		
		<p>
		For example, 
		<pre>
		This program decodes a textual message
		Each character is replaced with the character 2 places ahead in the alphabet.
		The characters "'", ".", "(", ")", and " " are not decoded.

		Please enter the message to decode: 250 Bedford Park Blvd W, 10468

		The decoded message is: 472 Dgfhqtf Rctm Dnxf Y, 32680
		</pre>
		
		<p>
		(Hint:  try the original program on the message below.  What are the differences in the 
		encoded messages it produces and the output above?)
	
	<li> Write a graphics program that changes colors depending where the user clicks on the 
		window.  If the user clicks on the left side, the window should turn green.  If the 
		user clicks on the right side, the window should turn red.  Your program should allow
		the user to click 5 times before ending the program.
	
</ol>
