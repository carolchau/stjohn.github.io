</div>


<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Write a program that displays a graphic display with your initials.  Your display 
		should contain at least two letters and 5 different graphic objects.  If your initials
		consist of very few lines (for example, if they were <tt>II</tt>), add extra decoration 
		to the display so that you use 5 different graphics objects.
	<li> Write a program that show a ball moving across the screen. The user should click on the 
		screen for the starting point, and the ball should move from top to bottom across the screen 
		for 1000 iterations of a loop.<br>
		Notes:
		<ul>
    		<li> To slow down the movement so that it can be seen, include in your loop, the command 
    			<t>time.sleep(0.1)</t> (also include the statement import time at the top of your program).
    		<li> If the user chooses a point close to the rightmost edge of the window, the ball will move out of view. 
		</ul>
	<li> Chapter 4, #9 (draw a rectangle from clicks)
	<li> 
	<li>
