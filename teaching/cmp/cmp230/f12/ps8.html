<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Write a program that asks the user to guess a secret number.  If they guess too high, you
	should print out a message saying that and let them guess again.  If they guess too low, you 
	should print out a message saying that and them them guess again.  When they guess correctly,
	you should thank them for playing, and the program ends.

	<li> Write a program that asks the user to enter a number between 1900 and 2012.  If they 
	enter a number out of range, print a message that the number is out of range and prompt
	them again for a number between 1900 and 2012.  When the user enters a number in range, print
	the number to the screen and end the program.

	<li> Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer (for example, 12345678). 
	The program sums the digits of the integer (in this example it gets 36). It then sums the digits 
	of that integer (in the example, it gets 9). It keeps going until it is down to a one-digit number, 
	which it prints.
	<li> Write a program that asks the users to enter a sequence of amounts to credit or debit to 
	their account.  Your program should continue to process their amounts as long as their balance
	is positive.  If at any point they have a negative balance, print a message and end the program.
	If you are able to process all the amounts, print the final balance to the screen before 
	ending the program.  You may assume that their beginning balance is $1000.
	
	<p>One sample run of the program:
	<pre>
	Please enter the amounts to credit/debit from your account, separated by commas:  -500,100.01,-1000,333.33,85.02,-200
	
	Beginning Balance:  $1000.00
	
	Amount: -500
	Balance: $500.00
	Amount: 100.01
	Balance: $600.01
	Amount: -1000
	
	Your balance has dropped below 0!  Please contact the bank immediately!
	</pre>
	
	<p>Another sample run of the program:
	<pre>
	Please enter the amounts to credit/debit from your account, separated by commas:  5.00,123.01,-600,7.89,-99.99
	
	Beginning Balance:  $1000.00
	
	Amount: 5.00
	Balance: $1005.00
	Amount: 123.01
	Balance: $1128.01
	Amount: -600
	Balance: $528.01
	Amount: 7.89
	Balance: $535.90
	Amount: -99.99
	Balance: $435.91
	
	Your final balance is:  $435.91
	</pre>
	<li> Write a program that reads in a text file, <tt>infile.txt</tt>, and prints out all the 
	lines in the file to the screen until it encounters an empty line.  Once it finds an empty line, 
	the program stops.
</ol>
