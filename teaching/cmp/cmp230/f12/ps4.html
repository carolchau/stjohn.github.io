</div>


<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li>  Write a program that has the user click on 6 points and then draws two 
		triangles.  The first three points clicked make up the first triangle,
		and the last three points clicked make up the corners of the second
		triangle.  Use the <tt>triangle.py</tt> program from the textbook as a basis 
		for this program.
	<li>  Write a program that takes two mouse clicks from the user and draws a circle
		centered at the first point and whose radius is the distance between the two
		points.  Use the <tt>triangle.py</tt> program from the textbook as a basis 
		for this program.
	<li> Write a program with a graphical user interface that asks the user for 
		the number of miles and displays the corresponding number of kilometers.
		Use the <tt>convert_gui.pyw</tt> program from 
		the text book as the basis for this problem.
	<li>  Write a program that allows the user to specify the number of dots draw
		to the screen.  Your program should have a text entry field and a button 
		for the user to click, and then should draw the number of dots to the
		screen that the user specified.  Use the <tt>convert_gui.pyw</tt> program from 
		the text book as the basis for this problem.
	<li> Modify the bouncing ball problem (from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</t>) to 
		``wrap'' around the screen twice.  That is, when the ball gets to the right end of the 
		screen, have it continue on the left hand side.  Hint:  use the remainder operator (%)
		to make sure that the y-coordinate is always between 0 and the width of the window.
