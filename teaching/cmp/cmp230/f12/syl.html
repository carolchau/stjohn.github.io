<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p><b>Expectations:</b>  Students are expected to learn both the material covered in 
class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading. Completing homework 
is an essential part of the learning experience. Students should review topics from 
prior courses as needed using old notes and books.

<p><b>Honor Code:</b> You are encouraged to work together on the
overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific
programs and homework assignments, all work must be your own. You
are responsible for knowing and following Lehman's <a href="http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/provost/enrollmentmgmt/collegenow/plagiarism/resources/Lehman_Policy.pdf">academic integrity code</a> (available from the
Undergraduate Bulletin, Graduate Bulletin, or the Office of Academic
Standards and Evaluations). <br>
All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Vice President of
Student Affairs. 

<p><b>Participation and Laboratory Work:</b>  Participation in class is an integral 
part of the learning experience.  Part of your grade will be based on submitting 
work completed during the laboratory sessions of the course and attending and
actively participating in both lecture and laboratory sessions.

<p><b>Homework:</b>  Programming exercises are posted on the class
website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts
covered in lecture.  Note that as the semester progresses, the
programs will take design and programming outside of class to
complete.  To receive full credit for a program, the program must 
perform correctly, must include comments, and be written in good style.
Of the five programs submitted
via Blackboard, two will be graded thoroughly and returned with comments.  

<p>The homework
grade will only be based on the two programs chosen each week (10 points each for
a total of 20 points a week).  No late homework is accepted.
Extra credit will be awarded for graded programs that are submitted
early.  If a graded program is submitted more than 12 hours early, 1 extra credit
point will be awarded.  For graded programs submitted more than 24 hours early, 2 extra
credit points will be awarded.

<p><b>Exams:</b> There will be two midterm exams and a final exam.  The dates of
the exams are:
<ul>
<li>First Midterm: 1/2 October
<li>Second Midterm: 31 October/1 November
<li>Final Exam times:
	<ul>
		<li> CMP 230 02 (T, Th 1-2:40pm): Tuesday, December 18th, 1:30-3:30pm
		<li> CMP 230 H401 & H402 (M, W 9-10:40am): Monday, December 17th, 8:30-10:30am
		<li> CMP 230 ZG81 (T, Th 6-7:40pm): Tuesday, December 18th, 6:15-8:15pm
		<li> CIS 166 01 & 02 (M, W 1-2:40pm): Wednesday, December 19th, 1:30-3:30pm
		<li> CIS 166 I401 (M, W 11-12:40pm): Wednesday, December 19th, 11:00am-1:00pm
		<li> CIS 166 ZF81 (M, W 6-7:40pm): Monday, December 17th, 6:15-8:15pm
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Grades:</b>  The grading for the course will be based on:
    <ul>
      <li>Participation & Laboratory Work: 10%
      <li>Problem Sets: 30% </li>
      <li>Exam 1: 15%       </li>
      <li>Exam 2: 15%       </li>
      <li>Final Exam: 30%       </li>      
    </ul>
  </li>

	<p> Since the final exam is comprehensive, if you do better on the final 
	exam than the midterm exams, the final grade can replace those grades.  This
	will be done automatically when your final grade is calculated.
	You must take and pass the final to pass the course.
	There are no make-up exams. </p>

<h3>Materials, Resources and Accommodating Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Textbook:</b> <i>Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science</i> by John Zelle
(ISBN 1887902996).  Approximate price: $40 (available on-line from 
<a href="www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> & <a href="www.powells.com">Powells</a>).


<p>
<b>Technology:</b> This course uses the <b>python</b> programming language.  It
is available on the department computers in Gillet Hall. 
See <a href="http://www.python.org">python website</a> for information on installing
it on your own machine.

<p><b>Computer Access:</b> Part of this course will use university
computer laboratories. These machines are for work related to
this course only and a code of conduct applies to computer use in the
department and on-campus. Misusing university computers could
result in losing your computer access for the rest of the term, making
it exceedingly difficult to complete this course.

<p>
<b>Tutoring:</b> Departmental tutoring is available in the Math Lab on the 2nd floor of Gillet Hall.
Additional office hours will be available by course instructors throughout the semester.
See the course Blackboard page for announcements.
