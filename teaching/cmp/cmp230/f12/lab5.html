<tt>Python Challenge</tt>

For today's lab, we are going to work through the first two problems of the
<a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/0.html">Python Challenge</a>,
which is a series of programming exercises.  The solution to each provides the
key to start the next one.  

<p>For the first challenge, you do not need to define a function, only use
the python shell to evaluate the mathematical expression. Take the number 
and use it as the URL to go to the next challenge.

<p>For the second challenge, the <tt>decode.py</tt> program from Chapter 5
(available at the book's website).

<p>After completing your program, go to <tt>Assignments</tt> in Blackboard
and click on the link: <tt>Lab 5</tt>.  Use the file upload interface
to upload your program.  Remember to click the <tt>Submit</tt> button before
closing the lab exercise.



<p> With the remaining time, start <a href="ps5.html">Problem Set 5</a>.
