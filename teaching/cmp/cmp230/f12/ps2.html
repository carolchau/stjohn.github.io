<p>
This assignment focuses on computing with numbers from Chapter 3.
</p>
</div>


<div>

<p>Submit the following programs via Blackboard:</p>

<ol>
	<li> Write a program that takes a length in yards and returns the number of 
		miles and yards (recall that there are 1760 yards to a mile).  For example, if
		the user entered, 2000, your program would output, <tt>1 miles 240 yards</tt>.
		Note that you should use "miles" and "yards" for all inputs (even
		in the cases where it is grammatically incorrect).  
	<li> Chapter 3, #4 (lightning strike):  write a program that determines the distance 
		to a lightening strike based on the time elapsed between the flash and the sound
		of thunder.  The speed of sound is approximately 1100 ft/sec and 1 mile is 5280 ft.
	<li> Write a program that asks the user for a number and then displays a countdown
		from that number.  That is, starts by displaying that number, then one less, 
		and continuing until it reaches 1.  Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter a number: 5
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Blast off!
		</pre>
		
	<li> Write a program to calculate how much money you would have if your money doubled
		every day.  Your program should ask the user for the number of days and display
		the amount of money for each day.  The starting amount of money is $1.
		Here is a sample interaction:
		<pre>
Please enter the number of days:  8
Day 1:  $1
Day 2:  $2
Day 3:  $4
Day 4:  $8
Day 5:  $16
Day 6:  $32
Day 7:  $64
Day 8:  $128
		</pre>
	<li> Chapter 3, #10 (ladder length):  write a program to determine the length of a ladder
		required to reach a given height when leaned against a house.  The height and angle of the ladder
		are given as inputs.  To compute the length use:
		
		 length = height/(sin angle)<br>
		
		Note: the angle must be in radians.  Prompt for an angle in degrees and use this 
		formula to convert:
		radians = &#960*degrees/180
		
</ol>
