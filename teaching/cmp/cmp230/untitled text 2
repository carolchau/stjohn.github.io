ideas for cmp 230, spring 12

more automated grading-- 
	quizzes along the lines of, 
		good design questions from the beginning:
			given these 5 python lines of codes (or functions)
			arrange them to produce the following output
			or perform in a certain way
		or which function call would you use, with what parameters
		some reading comprehension questions
		would it make sense to have a write the code, followed by 
			analyze the output
		could have elementary sorts in here, parameter passing,
			if statements
		or the first two lines of this program are missing, what 
			should they be to give output ...
			
use assignment instead of test to allow automatic downloading and cheat
	checking
	
see if safeassign can handle python programs
