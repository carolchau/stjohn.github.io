<h1>Quiz 3<br>
</h1>
<h2>LSP 150: Computers &amp; Society<br>
Lehman College-- CUNY<br>
Fall 2004</h2>
<hr><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Date:</span>&nbsp; 6 October
2004<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading:</span>&nbsp; Unit 2: The
Economy in <span style="font-style: italic;">Annual Editions</span>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<h3>Format</h3>
Quiz 2 consists of two parts:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz on the reading, and</li>
  <li>A short essay based on the reading.</li>
</ol>
For Part 1, the Blackboard system randomly chooses from a pool of
questions to make the quiz.&nbsp; If you are not happy with your score,
you can take the quiz over, and a new set of random questions will be
generated.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, you need to enter your essay answer to the chosen
question.&nbsp; Since there's several to choose from, make sure to
clearly mark at the beginning which question you have chosen to
answer.&nbsp; Spelling and grammar do count, so, please use a
spell-checker before entering your essay.&nbsp; Since Blackboard will
only accept plain text, it is probably easiest to write your essay in a
word processor and then cut-and-paste it into the quiz window.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The questions in Part 1 are straightforward and based on the
reading.&nbsp; The best way to study for this is to do the reading.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, choose one of the following questions and write a short
essay.&nbsp; Your essay should be about a page long and clearly address
the question.&nbsp; The questions below are modified from p 16 of the text:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. The overview to this units says, "you may be surprised to
learn... that some economists doubt the relationship between increseard
output per worker, that is, productivity, and information technology."
Are you surprised? Things change quickly. What do economists say now?<br>
<br>
2.
Does the assertion that up to 40 percent of all e-mail traffic is now
spam seem too large? Use the internet to find the source of this
figure. Do you beleive the estimates for the future growth in spam? Why
or why not?<br>
<br>
3. Should spam and all unsolicited email be
outlawed? Should all unsolicited US mail be outlawed? Discuss the
similarities and difference between your answers to these questions.<br>
