<h1>Quiz 7<br>
</h1>
<h2>LSP 150: Computers &amp; Society<br>
Lehman College-- CUNY<br>
Fall 2004</h2>
<hr><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Date:</span>&nbsp; 18 November
2004<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading:</span>&nbsp; Unit 6: Risk and
Security in <span style="font-style: italic;">Annual Editions</span>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<h3>Format</h3>
Quiz 2 consists of two parts:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz on the reading, and</li>
  <li>A short essay based on the reading.</li>
</ol>
For Part 1, the Blackboard system randomly chooses from a pool of
questions to make the quiz.&nbsp; If you are not happy with your score,
you can take the quiz over, and a new set of random questions will be
generated.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, you need to enter your essay answer to the chosen
question.&nbsp; Since there's several to choose from, make sure to
clearly mark at the beginning which question you have chosen to
answer.&nbsp; Spelling and grammar do count, so, please use a
spell-checker before entering your essay.&nbsp; Since Blackboard will
only accept plain text, it is probably easiest to write your essay in a
word processor and then cut-and-paste it into the quiz window.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The questions in Part 1 are straightforward and based on the
reading.&nbsp; The best way to study for this is to do the reading.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, choose one of the following questions and write a short
essay.&nbsp; Your essay should be about a page long and clearly address
the question.&nbsp; The questions below are from p 132 of the text:<br>
<br>
1. The overview of this unit mentions Michael Crichton's latest novel, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Prey</span>.&nbsp; The physicist Freeman
Dyson reviews this novel in the February 13, 2002 issue of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The New York Review of Books</span>
(http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16053).&nbsp; Do you agree with what
he has to say about the threats that technology hold for us?<br>
<br>
2. Kevin Mitnick, author of "Are You the Weak Link?" and a convicted
computer criminal, is now a computer security consultant.&nbsp; Can you
imagine a bank robber going to work for the banking industry?&nbsp; How
about a car thief consulting for the police department?&nbsp; Do these
examples say anything about the way we view white-collar crime in
general and computer crime in particular?&nbsp; Explain.<br>
<br>
3. Do you feel safe giving your credit card number to merchants over
the Web?&nbsp; Find out how (or if) your number is protected from
criminals who might traffic between you and the merchant?<br>
