<h3>Format</h3>
Quiz 2 consists of two parts:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz on the reading, and</li>
  <li>A short essay based on the reading.</li>
</ol>
For Part 1, the Blackboard system randomly chooses from a pool of
questions to make the quiz.&nbsp; If you are not happy with your score,
you can take the quiz over, and a new set of random questions will be
generated.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, you need to enter your essay answer to the chosen
question.&nbsp; Since there's several to choose from, make sure to
clearly mark at the beginning which question you have chosen to
answer.&nbsp; Spelling and grammar do count, so, please use a
spell-checker before entering your essay.&nbsp; Since Blackboard will
only accept plain text, it is probably easiest to write your essay in a
word processor and then cut-and-paste it into the quiz window.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The questions in Part 1 are straightforward and based on the
reading.&nbsp; The best way to study for this is to do the reading.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, choose one of the following questions and write a short
essay.&nbsp; Your essay should be about a page long and clearly address
the question.&nbsp; The questions below are from p 174 of the text:<br>
<br>
1. The article "Immigration and the Global IT Work Force" talks about a
shortage of technical workers.&nbsp; The government statistics cited
come from 1998.&nbsp; Has the situation changed since then?&nbsp; What
is the current occupational outlook for tech workers?<br>
<br>
2. Use the Internet to examine the arguments for H1-B visas to the
United States.&nbsp; What is your position on granting temporary visas
to technical workers?<br>
<br>
3. The writers of the article "Wiring the Wilderness in Alaska and the
Yukon," say "so far it is not bringing wholesale prosperity to any
village we could find."&nbsp; Is this surprising to you?&nbsp; Why or
why not?<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp; It is often argued that information technologies have the
potential to democratize polotically oppressive regimes.&nbsp; Do you
agree?&nbsp; Use the information in "The Quiet Revolution" and "Dot Com
for Dictators" in formulating your answer.<br>
