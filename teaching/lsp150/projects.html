For the project for this course, you have the choice of writing a 10-15
page term paper, expanding on the topics covered in class, or building
a robot and designing the accompanying programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>If you choose to build a robot: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Your project can have up to 5 programs (the total size of all
loaded programs cannot exceed 6K). </li>
  <li> Different lego configurations for different programs are
possible, but you must be able to convert from one to another <b>quickly</b>.
  </li>
  <li> Design ideas need to be submitted by 1 December, to make sure
that they're the right level of difficulty for the project. </li>
</ul>
Here's some possible ideas:
<ul>
  <li> a jukebox that plays songs on request </li>
  <li> a robot with an arm (see the last chapter of Baum's book) </li>
  <li> a robot that navigates a maze using the light sensor and bumpers
  </li>
  <li> a team of robots that cooperates in completing a task (like
playing tag, relay race, moving an object, etc.) </li>
  <li> <a

aerial tram</a></li>
