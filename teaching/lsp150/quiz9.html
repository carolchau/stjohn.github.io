<h1>Quiz 9<br>
</h1>
<h2>LSP 150: Computers &amp; Society<br>
Lehman College-- CUNY<br>
Fall 2004</h2>
<hr><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Date:</span>&nbsp; 9 December
2004<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading:</span>&nbsp; Unit 8:
Philosophical Frontiers in <span style="font-style: italic;">Annual
Editions</span>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<h3>Format</h3>
Quiz 2 consists of two parts:<br>
<ol>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz on the reading, and</li>
  <li>A short essay based on the reading.</li>
</ol>
For Part 1, the Blackboard system randomly chooses from a pool of
questions to make the quiz.&nbsp; If you are not happy with your score,
you can take the quiz over, and a new set of random questions will be
generated.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, you need to enter your essay answer to the chosen
question.&nbsp; Since there's several to choose from, make sure to
clearly mark at the beginning which question you have chosen to
answer.&nbsp; Spelling and grammar do count, so, please use a
spell-checker before entering your essay.&nbsp; Since Blackboard will
only accept plain text, it is probably easiest to write your essay in a
word processor and then cut-and-paste it into the quiz window.<br>
<br>
<h3>Topics</h3>
The questions in Part 1 are straightforward and based on the
reading.&nbsp; The best way to study for this is to do the reading.<br>
<br>
For Part 2, choose one of the following questions and write a short
essay.&nbsp; Your essay should be about a page long and clearly address
the question.&nbsp; The questions below are from p 198 of the text:<br>
<br>
1. 2003 marks the thirtieth anniversary of the publication of an essay
entitled "Animals, Men and Morals" by Peter Singer in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">New York Review of Books</span>.&nbsp;
This essay is often credited with beginning the animal rights
movement.&nbsp; Singer argues that because animals have feelings, they
can suffer.&nbsp; Because they can suffer, the have interests.&nbsp;
Because they have interests, it is, among other things, unethical to
conduct experiments on them.&nbsp; Suppose that scientists succeed in
developing machines that feel pain and fear.&nbsp; What obligations
will we have towards them?&nbsp; If this is difficult to imagine, watch
the movie <span style="font-style: italic;">Blade Runner</span> with
Harrison Ford.&nbsp; What do you think now?<br>
<br>
2. The overview to this unit says that the dollar value of the output
of the meat and poultry industries exceeds the dollar value of the
output of the computer industry.&nbsp; The overview mentions one reason
why we hear so much more about software than chickens.&nbsp; Can you
think others?<br>
<br>
3. Neither author, Ray Kurzweil or Michael Dertouzos, thinks that we
should limit certain lines of research.&nbsp; Do you?&nbsp; Why or why
not?<br>
